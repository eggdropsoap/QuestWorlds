You should note that this is version of 0.51 of the QuestWorlds System Reference Document. We expect to release revised versions of this SRD, especially after development of Chaosium’s upcoming QuestWorlds Core Book. When we release the QuestWorlds Core Book we will update the version designation to 1.0, indicating that the SRD reflects the text published in that book. If you are developing materials for QuestWorlds projects you may want to bear this in mind. We will track any changes to the SRD at https://github.com/ChaosiumInc/QuestWorlds.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Once we release SRD version 1.0 we expect that to be stable for some time.

  <div class="sectioncontent">
QuestWorlds 
   <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
is a roleplaying rules engine suitable for you to play in any genre.
   <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
It is a traditional roleplaying game in that there is a GM and players. The players play characters, each guided by the internal thoughts of their character as to what decisions they make, and the GM plays the world, including non-player characters (NPCs) and abstract threats.
   <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
It features an abstract, conflict-based, resolution method and scalable, customizable, character descriptions. Designed to emulate the way characters in fiction face and overcome challenges, it is suitable for a wide variety of genres and play styles. It is particularly suited to pulp genres (including their descendants comic books) and cinematic, larger-than-life, action.
   <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
It is a rules-light system that facilitates beginning play easily, and resolving conflicts in play quickly.
   <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
We refer to a rules-light but traditional roleplaying game as a storytelling game, after Greg Stafford’s definition in Prince Valiant.

     <div class="sectiontitle">Why QuestWorlds?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="sectioncontent">
QuestWorlds 
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
is meant to facilitate your creativity, and then to get out of your way.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
It is well suited to a collaborative, friendly group with a high degree of trust in each other’s creativity. Characters in QuestWorlds are described more in terms of their place in your imagination and the game setting than by game mechanics.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
If your group are often at odds and rely on their chosen rules kit as an arbiter between competing visions of how the game ought to develop, or use mechanical options to decide <div class="delimited quotation-1"><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-left">“</div><div class="delimitedcontent">what action to take,</div><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-right">”</div></div> QuestWorlds is not a rules set that provides that structure. Make sure to discuss with your group whether you are collectively on board with trying a new play style dynamic, or if you would rather stick to more structured systems.    </div>

The first version of these rules Hero Wars was published in 2000 (ISBN 978-1-929052-01-1)
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
The second version HeroQuest was published in 2003 (ISBN 978-1-929052-12-7). We refer to this as HeroQuest 1e to disambiguate.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
The third version HeroQuest: Core Rules was published in 2009 (ISBN 978-0-977785-32-2). We refer to this as HeroQuest 2e.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
HeroQuest Glorantha 
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
was published in 2015 (ISBN 978-1-943223-01-5). It is the version of the rules in HeroQuest 2e, presented for playing in Glorantha. We refer to this as HeroQuest 2.1e.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
QuestWorlds 
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
was published as a System Reference Document (SRD) (this document) in 2020. The version of the rules here is slightly updated, mainly to clarify ambiguities, from the version presented in HeroQuest 2e and HeroQuest 2.1e. This makes this ruleset HeroQuest 2.2e, despite the name change. However, to simplify we identify this version as QuestWorlds 1e.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
An Appendix lists changes in this version. As the SRD is updated we will continue to track version changes there.    </div>

    <div class="sectioncontent">
The primary audience for this document is game-designers who wish to utilize the QuestWorlds rules framework to implement their own game.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
We also recognize that some people will use this document to learn about the QuestWorlds system before purchasing it, and some players in games were the GM has a rule book, may use this as a reference to help understand the rules.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
For that latter reason, we address the rules here to a player.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
However, this remains a technical document with few examples, advice, or other non-rules text to help you play your game, as such are beyond the scope of this System Reference Document.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
It is expected that the designers of games you play based on these rules will include such guidance and context as is relevant to their game’s particular genre or setting, presented in a format better suited for learning how to play.    </div>

Your Game Master (GM) is the interface between your imagination and the game-world in which the PCs have their adventures; describing the people, places, creatures, objects, and events therein. Your GM also plays the role of any Non-Player Characters (NPCs) with whom your PC interacts in the course of your adventures.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
We generally refer to the GM as <div class="delimited quote-1"><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-left">‘</div><div class="delimitedcontent">your GM</div><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-right">’</div></div> in this document’s player-facing language.

  <div class="sectioncontent">
In a QuestWorlds game, stories develop dynamically as you and your GM work together to role-play the dramatic conflict between your group’s PCs in pursuit of their goals and the challenges, or threats that your GM presents to stand in your way. Stories advance by two methods: conflict, where your PC is prevented from achieving their goals because there is something that must be overcome, a story obstacle, to gain a desired person, thing, or even status: the prize; or revelation, where something must be overcome, a story obstacle, to learn a secret, uncover the past, or reach understanding: the prize.
   <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Over the course of play, your GM will present various story obstacles as conflicts to the PCs, resulting in either victory or defeat for your character, which determines whether or not you gain the prize you sought. These conflicts can represent any sort of challenge you might face: fighting, a trial or debate, survival in a harsh environment, out-wooing rival suitors, and so on.
   <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Rather than mechanically addressing the individual tasks that make up these conflicts, QuestWorlds usually assesses your overall victory or defeat in a single contest where you and your GM make an opposed roll pitting your characters ability vs the resistance the story obstacle presents to you achieving the prize.
   <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Whenever the GM presents a story obstacle for you to overcome, you should frame the contest by describing what you are trying to accomplish, the prize, and which of your abilities (see below) you want to use to achieve that prize, and how.
   <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Based on that framing and other factors, your GM will assess what resistance the characters face.
   <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
You roll a twenty-sided die (D20) against your PC’s ability, and your GM rolls a D20 against the resistance. Your GM will assess your overall victory or defeat in the contest based on the success or failure of both rolls, and narrates the results of your attempt to overcome the story obstacle and gain the prize accordingly. The direction of the story changes, in either a big or small way, depending on whether you gain the prize or not.
   <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
We encourage your GM to work with your suggestions when narrating the victory or defeat, but the final decision rests with them. 
   <div class="section level-3" id="abilities">
    <div class="sectioncaption">
     <div class="sectiontitle">Abilities</div>
    </div>
    <div class="sectioncontent">
Characters in QuestWorlds are defined by the abilities they use to face the challenges that arise in the course of their story. Rather than having a standard list of attributes, skills, powers, etc. for all characters, anything that you can apply to solve a problem or overcome a story obstacle could be one of your abilities. While your GM may provide some example abilities to choose from that connect your PC to a particular story or game world (whether created by your GM or by the designer of a particular game), you get to make up and describe most or all of your abilities.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Some abilities might be broad descriptions of your background or expertise, like <div class="delimited quotation-1"><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-left">“</div><div class="delimitedcontent">Dwarf of the Chalk Hills</div><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-right">”</div></div> or <div class="delimited quotation-1"><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-left">“</div><div class="delimitedcontent">Private Detective</div><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-right">”</div></div>—implying a variety of related capabilities. Others might represent specific capabilities or assets such as <div class="delimited quotation-1"><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-left">“</div><div class="delimitedcontent">Lore of the Ancients,</div><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-right">”</div></div> <div class="delimited quotation-1"><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-left">“</div><div class="delimitedcontent">Captain of the Fencing Team,</div><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-right">”</div></div> or <div class="delimited quotation-1"><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-left">“</div><div class="delimitedcontent">The Jade Eye Medallion.</div><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-right">”</div></div>
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Ultimately, abilities are just names for the interesting things your character can do.

Your character may have one or more flaws. A flaw is an ability that you do not use to accomplish something, but instead the GM uses to hinder you from accomplishing something, or invokes to force you to act a certain way.

A flaw also might be a relationship such as a <div class="delimited quotation-1"><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-left">“</div><div class="delimitedcontent">Frail Aunt,</div><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-right">”</div></div> <div class="delimited quotation-1"><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-left">“</div><div class="delimitedcontent">Single Dad,</div><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-right">”</div> </div>or <div class="delimited quotation-1"><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-left">“</div><div class="delimitedcontent">Blackmailed</div><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-right">”</div></div>.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Many flaws describe attributes that can be viewed positively. By making it a flaw and not an ability you are inviting your GM to use it to make your life more difficult, not easier.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
You should not use your flaw to accomplish something; if you feel that is likely, make it an ability and flag to your GM that you want them to draw on it as a flaw at appropriate moments. In that case, record both an ability and a flaw with the same name.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Ultimately, in QuestWorlds a flaw is simply something that you invite the GM to use to hinder or prevent your character doing something. In return for the GM exercising the flaw you gain experience points (see §8.1).      </div>

       <div class="sectiontitle">Scores, Ratings and Masteries</div>
      </div>
      <div class="sectioncontent">
QuestWorlds 
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
abilities are scored on a rating of 1–20, representing the target number (TN) you need to roll or less to succeed on your roll during a contest (see §2.3 for more details).
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Once your ability passes 20, you would always be able to roll under it on a D20. So to allow abilities to scale over 20 scores we use of tiers of capability we refer to as Mastery. To reflect abilities (or resistances) higher than 20, either permanently through character advancement or a temporarily with modifier to a contest roll, note a mastery for every 20 points in the ability, and treat what remains as the rating. So, for an ability of 27, we note one mastery and a rating of seven written as <div class="delimited quotation-1"><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-left">“</div><div class="delimitedcontent">7M</div><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-right">”</div></div> and we write the rating of 21, as 1M.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
The <div class="delimited quotation-1"><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-left">“</div><div class="delimitedcontent">M</div><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-right">”</div></div> after the rating signifies mastery. The number in front of the M is the rating, and represents the new target number you seek to roll or less. Whatever your roll, the mastery then bumps your result. You bump a success to a critical, and bump a failure to a success. If you roll a critical you can bump down your opponent. When both you and the resistance have masteries they cancel each other out.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Having a mastery means that you succeed most of the time and critical more often; you will only fail when you roll a fumble, and have a higher chance of a critical from rolling under the TN.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
For example, Trevor Okafor is trying to hover a helicopter over a ravine so that Bethany Ng can winch down to a stranded climber in high cross-winds. The GM calls for a roll. Trevor Okafor has 31 in Pilot, written as <div class="delimited quotation-1"><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-left">“</div><div class="delimitedcontent">11M</div><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-right">”</div></div>. Trevor’s player rolls against a TN of 11. They roll a 17 and fail, but Trevor’s mastery means the actual result is bumped up to a success on a 17. This beats the GM’s success on a 13. Later Bethany Ng is trying to stabilize the victim on the route back to hospital. Bethany has 27 in Medic, written as <div class="delimited quotation-1"><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-left">“</div><div class="delimitedcontent">7M</div><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-right">”</div></div>. Bethany’s player rolls against a TN of 7. They roll a 4 and succeed, but the mastery means that the actual result is bumped up to a critical on a 4, which beats the GM’s success on a 14.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Specific QuestWorlds games or genre packs may use other symbols relevant to their setting or genre to denote mastery instead of M. If so, this should be clearly noted by their designers.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
As a score climbs, you may even gain multiple masteries in it. Mastery tiers above one (representing an overall score or 41 or more) are marked with a number to the right of the M symbol. Each successive score increase over 20 becomes a new mastery tier. Thus, if you have 10M2, you have two masteries and a rating of 10, (representing a total score of 50). 10M3 means that you have three masteries and a rating of 10, and so on. Multiple masteries result in multiple bumps up, so with two masteries a critical bumps to a success.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
To simplify bumping, when both you and the resistance have masteries they cancel out.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
See §2.3.7 for more details on bumps.

        <div class="sectioncontent">
You may sometimes be faced with a story obstacle for which you have no relevant ability whatsoever. In such cases, you may still enter into conflict with the story obstacle using a minimum base target number of 6 for your contest roll. Like scores, it may also be subject to modifiers.        </div>

        <div class="sectioncontent">
QuestWorlds 
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
treats scores as a measure of how effective you are at solving problems with the ability, and does not limit what you can do with that ability, provided your actions are credible in genre. Where an important part of the genre is that certain uses of the ability are only available when you pass a threshold of experience, often through overcoming story obstacles to improve the ability in game, you may chose to set threshold for those abilities. For example, a magic system might classify certain supernatural effects as Apprentice, Journeyman, or Master level, and require ratings of 15, 5M, or 1M2 (respectively) in a relevant ability to even attempt them.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Such departures from abstraction should generally only be made where the increased complexity they bring leads to rewarding choices in a key area of interest to the setting or genre at hand. In most cases, you and your GM can simply follow the fiction surrounding your ability and its context within the setting for guidance as to what applications of the ability are credible.        </div>

    <div class="sectioncaption">
     <div class="sectiontitle">Possessions and Equipment</div>
    </div>
    <div class="sectioncontent">
Your character will generally be considered to have whatever equipment is reasonably implied by your abilities. Having an <div class="delimited quotation-1"><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-left">“</div><div class="delimitedcontent">Athenian Hoplite</div><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-right">”</div></div> ability will mean that your character possesses bronze armor, a shield, a spear, and a short-sword; while a <div class="delimited quotation-1"><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-left">“</div><div class="delimitedcontent">Country Doctor</div><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-right">”</div></div> would be expected to have a well-stocked medical-bag and possibly a horse &amp; buggy in the right setting.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
However, if you wish your character to possess something that is particularly special, interesting, or unusual, you may also enumerate it as a rated ability in its own right, just like any other ability your character might use to solve a problem.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
In play, the degree to which you can overcome story obstacles with your possessions depends not on any qualities inherent to the objects themselves, but to the score of your relevant ability. However the significance of various sorts of gear lies in the types of actions you can credibly propose, and what their impact might reasonably be. An <div class="delimited quotation-1"><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-left">“</div><div class="delimitedcontent">Invisibility Cloak</div><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-right">”</div></div> ability implies very different fictional capabilities than <div class="delimited quotation-1"><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-left">“</div><div class="delimitedcontent">Souped-up Muscle Car</div><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-right">”</div></div> does.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Conversely, if in the course of play you find your character in a situation without equipment essential to utilize an ability effectively, or where your character’s gear is poorly suited to the task at hand, your GM may take into account in assessing credibility-based modifiers.

In QuestWorlds, wealth is treated as just another way to overcome story obstacles. Many characters may not even have an explicit wealth ability, with their wealth or assets instead implied by abilities representing their background, profession, or status. Whether explicit or implied, the relevant score is not an objective measure of the size of your fortune, but instead indicates how well you solve problems with money and resources.      </div>

The basic resolution methods are as follows:

        <div class="sectioncaption">
         <div class="sectiontitle">Assured Contest</div>
        </div>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
Some obstacles don’t require a roll to overcome. You’ll just do it and keep going, much as you get dressed in the morning or drive your car to work. We call these kinds or contests assured contests because your victory is assured. Your GM may want to describe your victory as a sweat inducing challenge for you, even though there is no risk of defeat, to highlight the heroic struggle of your PC to beat the obstacle, nonetheless.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
As your character advances, the challenges that qualify for assured contests will become more complex. If you face a driving challenge, the bar for assured will be much lower for a champion Formula 1 racer than a typical commuter.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Assured contests 
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
are the GM’s primary tool to establish your character’s competence. This makes them one of the most powerful and frequently used tools in a GM’s tool chest. Remember, your GM doesn’t have to, and usually shouldn’t advise you you’re involved in an assured contest, so it’s best to treat all contests as if your skin is on the line.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Your GM may also use an assured contest when there is no interesting story branch from defeat. If failing to open the derelict spaceship’s hatch means that the story of your exploration of the ancient space hulk would end abruptly, your GM may choose to make it an assured contest. Assured contests may be used to find clues when your GM is running a mystery and correct application of one of your abilities should reveal the information and allow the story to continue, over becoming mired due to a missed roll and missing clue.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Sometimes your GM will decide potential complications could arise in overcoming an story obstacle. Or they may want to give you a bonus if you do particularly well. If so, they will call for you to make a die roll even though your victory is not in question. Your GM will use your die roll result to decide if any unforeseen consequences or benefits arose from your actions.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
If you roll a failure, you still beat the obstacle, but you also suffer an adverse consequence (see §2.7). The nature of this adversity is up to the GM. It will probably be a penalty involving the same tactic you used in this one (because you exhausted yourself, sprained an ankle, embarrassed yourself in front of your peers, etc.) or to the value of one of your relationships.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
If you achieve a high result, you’ll receive a benefit from your effort (see §2.6). Again, this is up to the GM to define. It could be a bonus to the tactic used in the contest, or to of one of your relationships, etc.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Fumbles 
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
and criticals always result in an unexpected difficulty or reward!

The simple contest is QuestWorlds’ primary resolution mechanic for overcoming story obstacles, and is used the most often where the outcome is uncertain. It also provides the foundation for other types of uncertain contest, including several long ones. As such, it receives both an overview of key concepts here as well as a more detailed treatment in §4.

Contests 
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
in QuestWorlds don’t simply tell you how well you performed at a particular task: they tell you whether or not you overcame a story obstacle, which moves the story in a new direction. Unlike some other roleplaying games, a contest in QuestWorlds does not resolve a task, it resolves the whole story obstacle.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
If you need secret records which are stored in a vault within a government compound, your goal is to get the information—while the fact that it is secured against your access is a story obstacle you must overcome to attain that goal. Overcoming that story obstacle may involve many possible tasks, evading guards, lock-picking, forging credentials, etc.—but the contest doesn’t address those individually. The contest is framed around the entire conflict against the story obstacle as a whole.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
In a fight, your story obstacle may be the opponents themselves, who you are fighting to capture or kill. Just as often you are seeking another goal and you might just as easily attain it by incapacitating or evading your foes. In this case, beating the enemy is a task, not the story obstacle. For example, if an ally has been accused of treason by the King, your goal could be to prove the ally’s innocence. The power of the King threatening your ally is a story obstacle to be overcome, and a trial by combat could be a contest to resolve the conflict with an ability like <div class="delimited quotation-1"><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-left">“</div><div class="delimitedcontent">Knight Errant.</div><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-right">”</div></div>
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
In a court trial, your goal is likely a particular verdict, while the story obstacle might be the opposing lawyer, an unjust law, or even the justice system itself. In this case, jury selection, a closing argument, revelatory evidence, or legal procedural challenges are tasks, not the entire story obstacle. The overall conflict encompasses all those things.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
A conflict to overcome a story obstacle moves the story forward when it is resolved. If it is merely a step toward resolving a story obstacle it is a task and not a conflict. While those component tasks may be interesting parts of narrating tactics and results, your GM should be sure to look for the story obstacle in conflict when framing a contest.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
If there is no story obstacle to your actions, your GM should not call for a contest but simply let you narrate what you do, provided that seems credible.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
For example, you are traveling from one star system to another. In the next star system you hope to confront the aged rebel who holds long-forgotten secrets that could bring freedom to the galaxy. Your GM feels there is no useful story obstacle for you to contest against, and so lets you describe heading down to the spaceport to secure a ship, meeting the captain and crew of your vessel, and traveling to the next world. Your GM encourages you to summarize what happens quickly so you can get to the meeting with the old rebel. Your GM knows that will be the real story obstacle, convincing the old rebel to part with their secrets.        </div>

       <div class="section subsubsection level-5" id="tactics">
        <div class="sectioncaption">
         <div class="sectiontitle">Tactics</div>
        </div>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
You either choose an ability that represents any <div class="delimited quote-1"><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-left">‘</div><div class="delimitedcontent">key moment</div><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-right">’</div></div> in overcoming that story obstacle, or a broad ability that lets you overcome the whole story obstacle. We call this choosing a tactic.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
The rating from your ability score, after adding any augment (see §2.5) or modifiers (see §2.4), relevant consequences or benefits (see §2.6) is your target number.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Your tactic might describe your using an ability that helps you overcome a task within the story obstacle: sneaking past the guards, picking the locks, choosing the right jury or skewering your opponent with your foil. Or, your tactics might describe using a broad ability like <div class="delimited quotation-1"><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-left">“</div><div class="delimitedcontent">Ninja</div><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-right">”</div></div>, <div class="delimited quotation-1"><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-left">“</div><div class="delimitedcontent">Lawyer</div><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-right">”</div></div>, or <div class="delimited quotation-1"><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-left">“</div><div class="delimitedcontent">Fencer</div><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-right">”</div></div> to overcome all those challenges that might form part of the story obstacle. Either way, if you succeed at that roll, you overcome the whole story obstacle. Or by failing at that roll, you fail to overcome the story obstacle, not just fail at one task.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
When deciding on your tactic, focus on how your unique abilities would help you overcome the story obstacle. This as the <div class="delimited quotation-1"><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-left">“</div><div class="delimitedcontent">key moment</div><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-right">”</div></div> where we focus on your PC. Use this moment to reveal your PC’s strengths to the group.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Your GM will determine if your tactic passes a credibility test. If you try to jump a 100 meters gap or run faster than a speeding car, your action is not credible and your GM will ask you to choose a different tactic.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Credibility depends on the genre, as what is not credible in a gritty police procedural might be in pulp where you might be able to leap from a bridge onto a speeding train. If in dispute, your GM should discuss with the group whether they consider your tactic credible for the genre.

         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
in some genres give you the capability to do the incredible. For example in a superhero genre you might fly or be invulnerable to bullets, in a fantasy genre hurl magical lightning bolts. A genre pack for the game should help define what incredible tactics are allowed for that game as part of an Extraordinary Powers Framework.

Your GM uses a rank when choosing to adjust a target number. That adjustment may come from an augment (see §2.5), modifier (see §2.4), benefits or consequences (see §2.7). Your GM also uses the same rank when determining the resistance.

      </div>
      <div class="sectioncontent">
Your GM chooses a resistance to represent the difficulty of the story obstacle.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
When setting resistances it is important to understand that whilst traditional roleplaying games simulate an imaginary reality, QuestWorlds emulates the techniques of fictional storytelling.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Understanding this distinction will help you to play the game in a natural, seamless manner.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
For example, let’s say that your GM is playing a game inspired by fast-paced, non-fantastic, martial arts movies in a contemporary setting. You are running along a bridge, pacing a hovercraft, piloted by the main bad guy. You want your character, Joey Chun, to jump onto the hovercraft and punch the villain’s lights out.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
In a traditional, simulative game, your GM would determine how hard this is based on the physical constraints you’ve already described. In doing so, they would come up with imaginary numbers and measurements. Your GM would have to work out the distance between bridge and hovercraft. Depending on the rules set, they might take into account your relative speed to the vehicle. Then they would use whatever resolution mechanic the rules provide them with to see if Joey succeeds or fails. If you blow it, your GM will probably consult the falling rules to see how badly you injure yourself (if you land poorly), or the drowning rules, if you end up in the river.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
In QuestWorlds, your GM starts not with the physical details, but with the proposed action’s position in the storyline. They consider a range of narrative factors, from how entertaining it would be for you to succeed, how much failure would slow the pacing of the current sequence, and how long it has been since you last scored a thrilling victory. If, after this, they need further reference points, your GM can draw inspiration more from martial arts movies than the physics of real-life jumps from bridges onto moving hovercraft. Having decided how difficult the task ought to be dramatically,your GM will then supply the physical details as color, to justify their choice and create suspension of disbelief, the illusion of authenticity that makes us accept fictional incidents as credible on their own terms. If they want Joey to have a high chance of success, your GM describes the distance between bridge and vehicle as impressive (so it feels exciting if you make it) but not insurmountable (so it seems believable if you make it).
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
In other words, in QuestWorlds your GM will pick a resistance based on dramatic needs and then justify it by adding details into the story.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Your GM determines the resistance from a base resistance modified by a rank depending on their view of how difficult the obstacle is for you. Increasing ranks make it harder to succeed, and decreasing ranks easier.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
By default, the base resistance starts at 14. The rank never reduces the resistance value below 6.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
All contests use the base resistance + rank, except for contests to determine augments. Augmenting always faces the base resistance.      </div>

Note that whatever your result the outcome will depend on comparing your roll with your opponents. So you might *succeed, but still lose the prize. At the same time, your GM should take into account your result when narrating the outcome, and not use your incompetence as a reason you failed to gain the prize if you succeeded, instead focusing on the resistance’s superiority despite your success.      </div>

You GM narrates the contest outcome. Their narration should take into account the prize and the tactics used by each side. Your GM may invite you to contribute more detail on your actions as part of that narration, if they wish. But the GM is the final arbiter of the how the story progresses as a result of the rolls—provided they respect the outcome in which you win or lose the prize.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Your GM should bear in mind your result when describing the outcome. For example, if you succeeded, but the resistance succeeded better, the GM should describe your actions as successful, but the resistance as doing better. If your result was a critical and the resistance’s result was a fumble your GM should describe a crushing defeat in which your adversary is clearly outclassed.

      <div class="sectioncontent">
A bump affects the degree of success or failure of your die roll. A bump up improves your result by one step, changing a fumble to a failure, a failure to a success, or a success to a critical. Bump ups come from two sources: masteries and story points (applied in that order). A bump down reduces the result by one step, changing a critical to a success, a success to a failure, or a failure to a fumble. Bump downs come from one source: masteries.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Bumps 
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
always affect results not outcomes, although the outcome could change as an effect of gaining a different result.

        <div class="sectioncaption">
         <div class="sectiontitle">Bump Up with Mastery</div>
        </div>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
If you’re engaged in a contest against a resistance, and you have a target number of 10M versus a resistance of 10, you enjoy an advantage. You get a bump to your die roll from that mastery.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
You get one bump up for each level of mastery your PC has greater than your opponent’s. So against a resistance of 14 a PC’s target number of 7M is treated as 7 vs. 14 but we bump the result one step in the favor of the PC; a PC’s ability of 3M2 is treated as 3 vs. 14 but we bump the result two steps in favor of the PC.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Opposed masteries cancel out, each contestant reducing their score by the same number of masteries until only one or neither of them has masteries. If you have two masteries, then you enjoy the same great advantage over an opponent with a single mastery as someone with one mastery has over an opponent with no masteries. If you have an advantage of two or more masteries over an opponent, you can pretty much count on pounding them into the dust.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
This allows QuestWorlds to represent large differences in ability or resistance.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
If the resistance is one or more levels of mastery greater than you, your GM can bump up their roll.        </div>

If you have a critical and still have one or more bumps left from your advantage over your opponent, you can use them to bump down your opponent, since you cannot get a result better than a critical. Bump down your opponent’s result for each mastery remaining. So against a resistance of 14, if you have an ability of 7M, you have one bump of the result. If you critical and the resistance gets a success, then as you cannot bump up from your critical, then you instead bump the resistance down to a failure.

Your score represents a general ability to succeed in the narrative, but modifiers reflect specific conditions that may make it easier or harder to overcome particular story obstacles. They are applied to your ability to get a final target number (TN).
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Positive modifiers are called bonuses; negative modifiers are called penalties.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Bonuses
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>

     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Penalties
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
, may lower an ability to the point where it loses one or more masteries. In this case, you lose the bumps up or down you would normally get.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Your GM should only use modifiers to alter your target number due to unusual circumstances you helped to create, or have some control over. If an unusual situation applies to a resistance, the GM should choose a resistance that reflects that. Modifiers never apply to the resistance.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
If penalties reduce your target number to 0 or less, any attempt to use it automatically results in failure. You must find another way to achieve your aim. 
     <div class="section subsection level-4" id="stretches">
      <div class="sectioncaption">
       <div class="sectiontitle">Stretches</div>
      </div>
      <div class="sectioncontent">
When you propose an action using an ability that seems completely inappropriate, your GM rules it impossible. If you went ahead and tried it anyway, you’d automatically fail—but you won’t, because that would be silly.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
In some cases, though, your proposed match-up of action and ability is only somewhat implausible. A successful attempt with it wouldn’t completely break the illusion of fictional reality—just stretch it a bit.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Using a somewhat implausible ability is known as a stretch. If your GM deems an attempt to be a stretch, the PC suffers a −3, −6, −9 penalty, or a bump down, to their target number, depending on how incredible the stretch seems to the GM and other players. Your GM should penalize players who try to create a <div class="delimited quote-1"><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-left">‘</div><div class="delimitedcontent">do anything</div><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-right">’</div></div> ability that they then stretch to gain from raising fewer abilities in advancement to ensure balance with other PCs.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
A default stretch penalty should be −6.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
The definition of stretch is elastic, depending on genre.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Your GM should not impose stretch penalties on action descriptions that add flavor and variety to a scene, but do not fundamentally change what you can do with your ability. These make the scene more fun but don’t really gain any advantage.      </div>

       <div class="sectiontitle">Situational Modifiers</div>

      <div class="sectioncontent">
Your GM may also impose modifiers when, given the description of the current situation, believability demands that you should face a notable bonus or penalty. Your GM should choose modifiers of +6, +3, –3, or –6. Modifiers of less than 3 don’t exert enough effect to be worth the bother. Those higher than 6 give the situational modifier a disproportionate role in determining outcomes.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>

    <div class="sectioncaption">
     <div class="sectiontitle">Augments</div>
    </div>
    <div class="sectioncontent">
You may sometimes face contests where more than one ability may be applicable to the conflict at hand. In such cases, you may attempt to use one ability to give a supporting bonus to the main ability you are using to frame the contest. This is called an augment. For example, if your character has the abilities <div class="delimited quotation-1"><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-left">“</div><div class="delimitedcontent">The Queen’s Intelligencer</div><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-right">”</div></div> and <div class="delimited quotation-1"><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-left">“</div><div class="delimitedcontent">Master of Disguise</div><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-right">”</div></div>, you might use the latter to augment the former when infiltrating a rival nation’s capitol. Similarly, a character with <div class="delimited quotation-1"><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-left">“</div><div class="delimitedcontent">Knight Errant</div><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-right">”</div></div> and <div class="delimited quotation-1"><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-left">“</div><div class="delimitedcontent">My Word is my Bond</div><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-right">”</div> </div>abilities might use one to augment the other when in conflict with a story obstacle the character has sworn to overcome.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Abilities that represent special items, weapons, armor, or other noteworthy equipment can be a common source of augments. However, this grows tired if over-used and you should try and restrict repeated use of equipment in this way to contests where they are particularly interesting or apropos.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Augments 
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
can also come from other characters’ abilities if one character uses an ability to support another’s efforts rather than directly engaging in the contest. Augments can even come from outside resources like support from a community, see §8, or other circumstantial help.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
If you have a good idea for an augment, propose it to your GM while the contest is being framed. When making your proposal, describe how the augmenting ability supports the main one in a way that is both entertaining and memorable. Don’t just hunt for mechanical advantage, show your group more about your PC when you augment, their attitudes, passions, or lesser known abilities. If you are augmenting with a broad ability like <div class="delimited quotation-1"><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-left">“</div><div class="delimitedcontent">Fool’s Luck</div><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-right">”</div></div>, be prepared to describe the unlikely events that tilt the scales in your favor. Your GM will decide whether the augment is justified and can refuse boring and uninspired attempts to augment, where you are just looking for a bonus to your roll and not adding to the story.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
You may only use one of your own abilities to augment the ability you are using in the contest, and you may not use an ability to augment itself. You may not use a breakout to augment it’s parent keyword, or another breakout from the parent keyword. However, augments from other players supporting you can add together with your own, along with other modifiers, including those from benefits and from plot augments.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
If your GM accepts your augment proposal, it will be resolved by one of the methods below. The main contest then proceeds as normal, with any bonus from the augment added onto the score of the ability chosen when framing the contest. The augment remains in effect for the duration of the contest.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
To grant an augment to yourself, or another PC, in an upcoming contest, your GM decides how uncertain the benefit of your ability is to the contest. In some genres, certain abilities, such as magic in a fantasy setting, may always be uncertain.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
If use of the ability to augment seems unlikely to fail, your GM may treat it as an assured contest. As with any assured contest GM might still ask you to roll if there is a risk that the augment results in a penalty to other abilities such as resources or relationships.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
If your GM decides it is uncertain whether your ability can augment this contest, you engage in a simple contest against the base resistance before the main contest begins to determine whether the augment attempt results in an advantage. Frame this augment contest with your GM, making it clear how your supporting ability will achieve the goal of making your ability in the main contest more effective. Augment contests may not themselves be augmented, and if your augment attempt ends in defeat, you may not make another attempt at an augment for the main contest.

    <div class="sectioncontent">
During play your GM may decide that your flaw has been triggered. A flaw might apply to the tactic you are using in upcoming contest, when it is called a hindrance (see §2.6.1). Alternatively a flaw might simply come into play when you want to describe your PC acting in a certain way, and your GM feels that one of your flaws could prevent this, or your GM feels that a situation raises a challenge that means one of your flaw means would lead to you responding in a certain way. (see §2.6.2).

      <div class="sectioncaption">
       <div class="sectiontitle">Hindrance</div>
      </div>
      <div class="sectioncontent">
if you describe a tactic for a contest that is in conflict with a flaw, your GM may decide to impose a penalty called a hindrance against you in the upcoming contest. Your GM may also use an ability on your character sheet against you in this way too, if appropriate. This may be the case for relationships you have, philosophies you espouse, or groups you belong to. Your GM should trigger a hindrance from a keyword more frequently than from a stand-alone ability that is not a flaw. Your GM may treat their use of an keyword as a flaw as a stretch when invoking it.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Your GM should follow a similar approach to augments when applying a hindrance (see §2.5). They should ask themselves if it is fresh, interesting or illuminates character. In a movie of book would your flaw be prominent here?
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
If your GM feels that there is no uncertainty as to whether the flaw applies to your tactic in the contest they apply a penalty of −3 or −6 depending on how serious a handicap the flaw is. (This is, in effect a reverse assured contest in the GM’s favor). You may also suggest to the GM that you feel the flaw would apply without a contest.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
If your GM feels that it is uncertain as to whether the flaw hinders you, or you are able to overcome it, and you agree that you wish to try, treat it as a simple contest. Roll the rating of your flaw against the base resistance. On a victory, you receive a penalty of −3 or −6 depending on how significant a hindrance your GM feels the flaw is to your tactic. On a defeat, you overcome the flaw. You may want to describe how you overcome your flaw to use your tactic.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
When you experience a penalty due to a flaw, you gain an experience point (see §8.1).      </div>

      <div class="sectioncontent">
At times the direction of the story you are all telling may place your PC in situations when it seems likely they would act according to their flaw. The addict may reach for drink or drugs following an emotional setback, a lust for vengeance may come between your PC and showing mercy, prejudices or bigotry may prevent your from seeing others positively.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
If you chose to act according to your flaw there is no contest, simply describe your character behaving as the flaw dictates. This might result in a hindrance to further actions (see §2.6.1)
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
If you wish to act against your flaw, your tactic must pass a credibility test as to how you try overcome your flaw in this instance. In effect, pick an ability to resist the flaw with. Then you must obtain a victory in a simple contest against your flaw. On a victory you may act in a way that contradicts your flaw.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
If you submit to your flaw, your GM might impose a hindrance on further actions (see §2.6.1). You should not contest this hindrance unless the situation is not related to the one which triggered your flaw in this instance, or significant time has now passed.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Your GM may impose a penalty against an ability if you gain the victory against your flaw representing your struggle against your inner nature, violating dearly held principles, or letting down dependents. This is often true where the GM invokes a flaw from a keyword. For example, if you had they keyword <div class="delimited quotation-1"><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-left">“</div><div class="delimitedcontent">Gangster</div><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-right">”</div></div> and decide to inform on a fellow mobster, your GM might invoke the flaw of <div class="delimited quotation-1"><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-left">“</div><div class="delimitedcontent">Code of Silence</div><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-right">”</div></div> even if it is not a breakout under you keyword; this is particularly appropriate where facts such as the <div class="delimited quotation-1"><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-left">“</div><div class="delimitedcontent">Code of Silence</div><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-right">”</div></div> have been established in game. Even if you overcome your flaw, and inform on your fellow mobster, the GM might still impose a penalty on use of the keyword to interact with your crime family for having breached the <div class="delimited quotation-1"><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-left">“</div><div class="delimitedcontent">Code of Silence.</div><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-right">”</div></div>
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Similarly, your GM might give you a bonus for acting according to your flaw. representing the sacrifices you have made for dependents or a temporary boost from satisfying your inner demons. For example, if your superhero <div class="delimited quotation-1"><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-left">“</div><div class="delimitedcontent">Speedster</div><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-right">”</div></div> goes to see the premiere of his partner’s new play, instead of heading to the docks to stop Dr. Squid’s shipment of Vibrium, your GM might award you a bonus to your relationship to your partner.

If your GM compels you to act according to your flaw, you gain an experience point (see §8.1).      </div>

     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Your GM may simply determine these from what makes fictional sense, given the agreed prize for the contest, as described above. Optionally your GM may impose consequences or provide benefits if they desire ongoing penalties or bonuses. Your GM should always respond to the flow of the story, if narrative consequences are enough, they should not reach for additional mechanical bonuses or penalties. Your GM should use mechanical bonuses or penalties where it strains credibility that there is no ongoing consequence or benefit from the outcome of the contest.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
In a fight, it may strain credibility that a defeat does not leave you impaired for further physical activity. In a display or oratory before the assembled townsfolk, it may strain credibility if they would not later act according to your rousing words.

        </div>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
Your GM should not impose a narrative consequence on your PC that takes them permanently out of the game, such as by death, without discussion. Some games allow characters to be taken out of the story by the result of a dice roll, but QuestWorlds is a co-operative storytelling game where a failed dice roll should not automatically remove a character from play. However, you, or the GM, might feel that your PC’s story has come to an end with this failure, and you can consent to that outcome. Usually, your GM should refrain from suggesting this option unless the story itself suggests it.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
A story-ending outcome may not just be death. It can include anything that takes the PC out of play, such as exile, dismissal from the secret agency, a broken heart. In some cases the ending to your PCs story could be ambiguous, allowing the PC to return at a future point when the story makes their salvation possible.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Your GM might declare that the stakes of a particular contest place a PC at risk of this being a story ending moment, before the dice are rolled. This may be important for credibility in the story that the group is telling, In this case there should be an option for the PC to avoid, or backdown from a contest, that has a risk of ending their story.        </div>

The worse the penalty, the longer it may last, though the GM may reduce its rank with time, as you recover or heal.

You can heal physical injuries with medical or extraordinary abilities.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
You can remove mental traumas, including those of confidence and morale, with mundane psychology or through extraordinary abilities. You might also remove them through a dramatic confrontation between the victim and the source of the psychic injury.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
You use social abilities to heal social injuries. You probably have to make a public apology of some sort, often including a negotiation with the offended parties and the payment of compensation, either in disposable wealth or something more symbolic.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
You can fix damage to items and equipment with some sort of repair ability. If you want to fix an extraordinary item, you may require genre-specific expertise: a broken magic ring may require a ritual to reforge.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Your GM should almost always resolve healing attempts as simple contests. An exception might be a medical drama, in which surgeries would comprise the suspenseful set-piece sequences of the game, and your GM might chose a long contest.        </div>

         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Your GM can more easily calculate this as the base resistance with a bonus that is equal to and opposite your penalty. So if you have a penalty of −3, it is base resistance +3; if you have a penalty of −6, it is base resistance +6 and so on.

At the beginning of a session, especially when a significant period of game-world time passes between the conclusion of one session and the beginning of the next, the GM may declare that all benefits have expired or waned. A waning benefit may reduce its rank with time, as the effect fades. You are no longer charged with the confidence of your recent victory, the fans have forgotten your last concert, or the people of the village have started to think once again about the day-to-day struggle of their lives not how the stranger helped them.

A PC may apply bonuses from multiple benefits to a single contest, or apply penalties from multiple consequences to a single contest. Benefits and consequences may cancel each other out.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Because it is confusing to track both benefits and consequences against the same ability your GM may simply rule that one cancels the other out. This is particularly true of social contests where a moment of shame can erase your previous triumphs, or your confidence eroded by a failure. Physical benefits may cancel out, flushed with victory you may be able to ignore pain, but it may defy credibility for wounds to be healed by an athletic performance.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Your GM may simply rule that benefits and consequences cancel out, or they may take the difference between the two benefits and create a new one. For example if you have a +6 bonus from impressing the crowd with your previous performance in the dance contest, but then suffer an injured ankle with a penalty of −3, your GM may rule that your twisted ankle cancels out your energy from the last performance, or your GM might rule that your success sees you through the pain, but you are now only +3 to impress the crowd.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Your GM may prefer to cancel out in ranks so that if you have a rank 4 benefit from your popularity with the village following saving their holy idol, giving you a +M bonus, but you make a minor social gaff at the mayor’s daughter’s wedding of rank 1, you drop one rank to 3, and a +9 bonus, over reducing +M to 17. This keeps the numbers used for bonuses and penalties consistent, at the cost of having to track or figure out the rank of the bonus.      </div>

    <div class="sectioncontent">
Your GM may decide that resistance to your actions gets harder, as the campaign progresses. This reflects the trope of the type of challenges you face getting tougher as you improve.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Your GM should adopt a strategy that mimics a TV show where the resistance does not increase during a season of the show, allowing our protagonists to get more competent as the show progresses towards its climax. In the next season though the resistance usually goes up, and the writers reflect this with more challenging opposition in the new season of the show. At the same time, the opposition that was tough in the first season, now become mooks that can be easily dispatched to show the increased competence of the protagonists.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
In that case your GM should increment the base resistance by +3, +6 or +9 for the next campaign you play with the same characters. The size of the change should reflect the increase in your previous abilities in the last campaign. For example, if in the last season you increased your occupation keyword by +6, your GM may decide to increase the resistance by +3 or +6 to reflect the more challenging opposition in the new campaign. The GM should consider triggering resistance progression when your PCs find it difficult to earn experience points because they too regularly outclass even the climatic encounters (the boss monsters) of their game.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Your GM should also take into account that the opposition you were improving with respect to the previous season should now be considered more-easily defeated mooks, and use lower scores for them when they appear in the story or even allow them to be taken out with an assured contest.

On certain occasions your GM may rule that you can only hope to achieve the prize by using two disparate abilities. When this occurs, average your two ability scores, then apply any modifiers, to arrive at your TN.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Combining your abilities, rather than using the best one and augmenting it with other, is always a disadvantage. Your GM should only require combined ability use when story logic absolutely demands that you face a lower chance of success, because you have to do two things at once.    </div>

Sometimes, the two sides in a contest may have goals that do not directly conflict one another. A huntsman pursues a nurse, who is trying to escape through the forest with two small children. The huntsman wants to kill the nurse. The nurse wants to save the children.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
When encountering mismatched goals, your GM should determine whether the mismatch is complete, or partial.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
In a complete mismatch, neither side is at all interested in preventing the other’s goal. A complete mismatch does not end in a contest; your GM asks what you are doing, and then describes each participant succeeding at their goals.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
In most instances, the contest goals are not actually mismatched, but graduated. You have both a primary and a secondary goal. In this case, your GM frames the contest, identifying which goal is which. To achieve both, you must get a higher result than your opponent, such as success vs. failure or a critical vs success. On a better roll alone, such as success vs. success or failure vs failure, your GM may present you with the choice of which objective you obtain, where that choice illuminates your PC’s priorities.    </div>

Sometimes you will face large numbers of opponents. Your GM can treat many as one. Your GM divides the number of opponents by the number of contesting PCs. Your GM then treats each of these sections of the crowd as a single opponent with one score. Their numbers are factored into the score your GM assigns to them.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
If in doubt, your GM should think of the resistance that would be dramatically appropriate for a single opponent and then adjust it with a bonus of +3, +6 or +9 depending on how outnumbered you are. No more than six foes can typically contend with you in a physical confrontation, or two in a social one, or they tend to get in each other’s way.

When the mob loses an exchange, your GM describes individuals within it as being hurt or falling away. When it wins, describe them overwhelming you, or swelling in numbers.    </div>

As above, if in doubt, the GM should think of the resistance that would be dramatically appropriate for a one-on-one confrontation and then adjust it with a penalty of −3, −6, or −9 depending on how significantly you outnumber them. As above, note that unless your opponent is extraordinarily large, you cannot confront them physically with more than about six people (include followers) or socially with about two people (again include followers) or people just get in each other’s way.    </div>

  <div class="sectioncontent">
The first step in creating your character is to come up with a concept that fits in with the genre of game that your GM intends to run. With that, you can assign abilities, scores for those abilities, and if required flaws.
   <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
In addition, you will want to give your character a name, and provide a physical description. We recommend focusing on three physical things about your PC that others would immediately notice, over anything more detailed.
   <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Your GM should not use this method for creating NPCs. NPCs do not require definition via abilities and keywords. Instead, your GM simply describes the NPC, and picks an appropriate resistance in any contest with them, based on their feeling for what would be credible for that NPC. If in doubt the GM just uses the base resistance for a mook, with a suitably higher rank for a boss. The design intent is to remove the need for the GM to prepare stat blocks, making improvisation of NPCs easier, and shifting focus to the NPCs personality or role in the story instead.

Some genre packs may require you to have additional keywords that reflect the setting. These additional keywords come from the 12 abilites allowance, so in many genres you will have fewer wildcard abilities but better fit the setting.    </div>

   <div class="section level-3" id="keywords">
    <div class="sectioncaption">
     <div class="sectiontitle">Keywords</div>
    </div>
    <div class="sectioncontent">
You may build your PC around one or more keywords. A keyword gives you a package deal: you get a number of abilities by selecting a pre-existing character concept, which the player then modifies.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Keywords 
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
are best suited for use as the PC’s occupation.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
In certain genres, you may require multiple keywords: for example, one for occupation, another for species or culture, and perhaps a third for religious affiliation.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Here are two ways to handle keywords. If in doubt, choose Umbrella.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Keywords as Packages
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
: Treat keywords simply as shorthand for a package of abilities. These can be increased together during character creation, but are too unrelated to increase together during a game. You are still free to use the keyword as an ability, and in fact may prefer to write only the specific abilities they’ve improved on their character sheet.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Keywords as an Umbrella
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
: Treat keywords both as raisable abilities and as a collection of more specific abilities. This approach keeps the character sheet from getting too cluttered but encourages specialization. If your character is particularly good at an aspect of that keyword, you create a breakout ability under the keyword at a bonus from the score of the keyword you write these specialized breakout abilities under the keyword, along with how much they’ve improved from the keyword:
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Detective 17 Forensics +2 Handgun +1
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
In this example, whilst the score for most contests in which Detective was an appropriate tactic would be 17, for contests involving Forensics it would be 19, and for those involving firing a handgun it would be 18.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
In some settings, an ability may be listed in more than one of a PC’s keywords. Choose only one to detail it under.    </div>

    <div class="sectioncaption">
     <div class="sectiontitle">Flaws</div>

are assigned a score equivalent to your abilities. The first flaw is rated at the highest ability, the second shares the same score as the second-highest ability, and the third equals the lowest ability.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Certain keywords include flaws. Flaws gained through keywords do not count against the limit of three chosen flaws. All flaws after the third are given the same score as the third ability. You may designate flaws from keywords as your first or second-ranked flaw.    </div>

Most conflicts should be resolved simply and quickly, using the simple contest rules.
   <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
However, every so often, your GM wants to draw out the resolution, breaking it down into a series of smaller actions, increasing the suspense you feel as you wait to see if they succeed or fail.
   <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Think of the different ways a film director can choose to portray a given moment, depending on how important it is to the story, and how invested they want us to feel in its outcome.
   <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
For example, there are two ways to shoot a scene in which a thief breaks into the bank to steal the contents of the safe.
   <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
The action can be portrayed quickly, cutting to a moment with the thief, their ear pressed against the safe trying to get the tumblers to fall into place. Then they sigh with relief, open the safe, and get whatever is inside. In this instance, the story is about what happens after the thief gets what’s in the safe, not about what might happen to them if they fail.
   <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Another film might instead choose to make the bank robbery a pivotal turning point in the story, if not its climactic moment. It would spend many scenes building up to the safe-cracking sequence: obtaining the plans of the bank, learning the movements of the guards, crawling through the air conditioning ducts, sliding past the motion sensors and pressure plates, and finally cracking the safe itself. All of these scenes would be rounds of a long contest.
   <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Remember that QuestWorlds uses conflict resolution. If you want to describe how you overcome a sequence of story obstacles to overcome the resistance then your GM should use a long contest, if you just want to move on to the next scene, use a simple contest.
   <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Even a movie driven by action and suspense will typically include only a handful of these set-piece sequences. They need the rest of their running time to build up to their big moments, to make us care about the characters, and to give us quiet moments to contrast with the white-knuckle parts.
   <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
So pacing may always trump your desire to work through the sequence of events, as your GM may wish to resolve this conflict quickly. This is especially true if only one player is involved.
   <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Your GM may be tempted, to adjudicate every fight with a long contest, because fights seem like they should be played out blow-by-blow. They should resist this temptation, as fights are often repetitive trading of blows that can drag when everyone repeats actions from round to round. Only use long contests for fights where the PCs want to do more than slug it out toe-to-toe with their opponents until only one is left standing.
   <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
There are three types of long contest. Your GM should choose ONE to use with their campaign: scored contest, extended contest, or chained contest.

    <div class="sectioncontent">
Scored contests 
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
are longer and more dramatic than simple contests. Your GM uses scored contests when the outcome of the struggle is important, to generate suspense for you, or when your GM want a back-and-forth struggle. It is something you and your GM should visualize and describe.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
A scored contest consists of one or more rounds, in which you perform actions that are similar to simple contests. However, actions and rounds do not decide the outcome of the whole contest, only who gains or loses resolution points at that time. In a scored contest there is no distinction between aggressor and defender, each round represents attempts by both parties to overcome their opponent. Your GM should determine who has the initiative to describe what they are doing for any exchange, based on their interpretation of the flow of events. If in doubt your GM should defer to you over your opponent to describe what you do in the round, and describe the NPC reacting to that.

Unlike in an extended contest (see below), where you usually take part in two exchanges with your opponent per round (one in which you choose the AP bid, and one in which your opponent does), here you and your opponent engage in a single exchange per round (in which whoever the GM determines has initiative describes an action to seize the prize and their opponent how they intend to stop them).

You can summarize this as: one more resolution point than the levels of difference between the results.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Your resolution point score tells you how well you’re doing, relative to your opponent, in the ebb and flow of a fluid, suspenseful conflict. If you’re leading your opponent by 0–4, you’re giving them a thorough pasting. If you’re behind 4–0, you’re on your last legs, while your opponent has had an easy time of it. If you’re tied, you’ve each been getting in some good licks.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
In a fight, scoring 1 RP might mean that you hit your opponent with a grazing blow, or knocked him into an awkward position.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Scoring 2 RPs might mean a palpable hit, most likely with bone-crunching sound effects.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
A 3 RP hit sends them reeling, and, depending on the realism level of the genre, may be accompanied by a spray of blood.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
However, the exact physical harm you’ve dished out to them remains unclear until the contest’s end. When that happens, the real effects of your various victories become suddenly apparent. Perhaps they stagger, merely dazed, up against a wall. Maybe they fall over dead.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
In a debate, a 1 RP might occasion mild head nodding from spectators, or a frown on your opponent’s face.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
2 RPs would occasion mild applause from onlookers, or send a flush to your opponent’s face.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
On 3 RPs, your opponent might be thrown completely off-track, as audience members wince at the force of your devastating verbal jab.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
In interpreting the individual simple contests within a scored contest, your GM is guided by two principles:

       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>

       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Your GM may apply consequences and benefits as they see fit. The scale of those consequences and benefits may be guided by the difference in resolution points between the two sides.      </div>

In the round immediately after you take an opponent out of the contest, you may attempt to gain another prize from your opponent suffers by engaging in a parting shot. This is an attempt (metaphoric or otherwise) to kick your opponent while he’s down:

       </div>
You should agree an additional prize that you desire beyond the stakes agreed at the beginning of the contest. If you succeed in a parting shot you will also gain that prize. Your GM should agree that the additional prize makes sense as an opportunity brought about by your opponent’s defeat.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Your GM should not use a parting shot.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
The parting shot is another simple contest against your defeated opponent. The ability you use must relate to the consequences the opposition will suffer, but needn’t be the same one you used to win the contest. If the loser is a PC they use a suitable ability to resist; otherwise the GM rolls a suitable resistance value.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
If you succeed in your parting shot roll, you gain the additional prize.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
However, if your opponent succeeds, they take the number of resolution points they would, in a standard round, score against you, and instead subtracts them from the number of resolution points scored against them in the round that removed them from the contest. If the revised total is now less than 5 RPs, they return to the contest, and may re-engage you. Your GM describes this as a dramatic turnaround, in which your overreaching has somehow granted them an advantage allowing them to recover from their previous misfortune. The provisional consequences they suffered now go away, and are treated as a momentary or seeming disadvantage.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Where it makes sense, unengaged PCs may attempt parting shots against opponents taken out of the contest by someone else. You may not revive your teammates by using your lamest abilities to make parting shots on them; this, by definition, does not pass a credibility test.      </div>

      <div class="sectioncontent">
You may choose to briefly suspend your attempt to best your opponent in a scored contest, in order to do something else. An instance where you are trying to do something else and your opponent is trying to win the contest is called an asymmetrical round.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
In an asymmetrical round, you do not score RPs against your opponent if you win the round. Instead, you succeed at whatever else you were doing. You still lose RPs if you fail. Often you will be using an ability other than the one you’ve been waging the contest with, one better suited to the task at hand. This becomes additionally dangerous when the score associated with your substitute ability is significantly lower than the one used for the rest of the contest.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
In addition to secondary objectives, as in the above example, you may engage in asymmetrical round to grant augments (see above) to yourself or others.      </div>
     </div>

      <div class="sectioncontent">
You can always abandon a contest, but, in addition to failing at the story obstacle, you may also suffer negative consequences. In a contest where your opponent intends to harm you, you will always suffer negative consequences if you withdraw, unless you successfully disengage.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
To disengage, you make an asymmetrical round, using the ability relevant to the contest you’re trying to wriggle out of.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
If you fail, your effort is wasted and the score against you increases, as it would have during a normal round. If you succeed, you escape the clutches, literal or metaphorical, of your opponent, without further harm from a contest during the rising action. In a climactic scene, however, RPs scored during contests you disengaged from are still taken into account when determining consequences. In the case of a group contest, consequences against you are determined as soon as you disengage.      </div>

Group scored contests 
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
proceed as a series of scored contests between pairs of PC and opponents, interwoven so that they happen nearly simultaneously.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
As in a scored contest between a single PC and an opponent, only one simple contest per pair of adversaries occurs each round. Usually the PCs make up one team, and their antagonists the other.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
A group scored contest continues until one side has no active participants. If you defeat your opponent you can pair with a new opponent. The new opponent might be unengaged, but might also be engaged in an existing pairing. When you pair with a new opponent, you begin a new contest, even if your opponent is already engaged in a contest. Alternatively, if you are unopposed, you may choose to assist. Of course, you may be later engaged by an opponent who becomes free yourself.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
You may lose some pairings amongst the PCs, but still win if the last participant standing is a PC; otherwise if the last participant belongs to the opposition you lose.

In a group scored contest the team that has the last undefeated contestant gains the prize.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Your GM may decide that you suffer individual consequences or gain individual benefits from the outcome of the contests you pursued, regardless of whether your team won or lost. You might be on the winning team, but lost your individual contest and suffer a penalty to ongoing actions as a result. Alternatively, you might be on the losing team, but win your individual contest and gain a benefit as a result. If you lost, your benefit should not be the prize but instead reflect a side-affect of your individual triumph. Similarly, if your team won, your consequence should not limit the prize which your team one, but should reflect a side-affect of your individual loss.

      </div>
      <div class="sectioncontent">
If you are not currently enmeshed in a round, either after a successful disengagement, or after winning a round, you may take actions within the scene that do not directly contribute to the defeat of the other side. These unrelated actions may grant an augment to yourself or to a teammate. You may achieve a secondary story objective. This resembles an asymmetrical round, except that, as you are not targeted by any opponents, there is no additional risk.      </div>

      <div class="sectioncaption">
       <div class="sectiontitle">Assists</div>
      </div>
      <div class="sectioncontent">
You may take an unrelated action to grant an assist to a teammate enmeshed in a round. Assists are subject to the same restrictions as augments: they must be both credible and interesting.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Your first assist faces a moderate resistance. Each subsequent assist attempt to the same beneficiary, steps up by one step on the scale:+3, +6, +9, +M, +M2. The resistance escalation occurs even when another PC steps in to make a subsequent assist. This escalation allows the occasional dramatic rescue but makes it difficult for players to prolong losing battles to excruciating length. Your GM should make it seem credible by justifying the increasing resistances with descriptions of ever-escalating countermeasures on the part of the opposition.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Your GM may adjust the starting resistance up or down by one step to account for campaign credibility or other dramatic factors. If an assist as proposed seems too improbable or insufficiently useful, your GM should collaborate with you to propose alternate suggestions which would face moderate resistance.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
The assist alters the score against your teammate according to the outcome of a simple contest.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
If you have the same result, but a better level of success, you reduce the resolution points by 1; if you have one level of difference, such as critical vs a success or a success vs a failure you reduce then resolution points by 2; if you have two levels of difference, such as a critical vs a failure or a success vs a fumble you reduce the reduce the resolution points by 3; if you have three levels of difference from a critical vs. a fumble you reduce the resolution points by 4.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
If you lost the contest, you will worsen your allies position.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
If you have the same result, but a lower level of success you increase the resolution points by 1; if you have one level of difference, such as a success vs a critical or a failure vs a success you increase the resolution points by 2; if you have two levels of difference, such as a failure vs a critical or a fumble vs. a success you increase the resolution points by 3. If you fumble against a critical you increase the resolution points by 4.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
If you fail with a lesser success, your GM may interpret the actions as a distraction that allows your opponent advantage. If you fail, your GM may interpret your actions as backfiring and making inflicting harm.

      <div class="sectioncontent">
You may choose to have your followers take part in group scored contests in one of three ways: as full contestants, as secondary contestants, or as supporters.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Contestant
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
: The follower takes part in the contest as any other PC would. You roll for your followers as you would their main characters. However, your followers are removed from the contest whenever 3 resolution points are scored against them in a given round.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Secondary contestant
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
: To act as a secondary contestant, your follower must have an ability relevant to the contest. The follower sticks by your side, contributing directly to the effort: fighting in a battle, tossing in arguments in a legal dispute, acting as the ship’s navigator, or whatever. Although you describe this, you do not roll for the follower. Instead, you may, at any point, shift any number of resolution points to a follower acting as a secondary contestant. Followers with 3 or more resource points lodged against them are removed from the scene.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Supporter
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
: Your follower is present in the scene, but does not directly engage your opponents. Instead they may perform assists and other unrelated actions.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Followers 
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
acting in any of these three capacities may be removed from the contest by otherwise unengaged opponents. To remove a follower from a scene, an opponent engages your follower in a simple contest. Your GM sets the resistance, or if it is another PC’s follower they determine the relevant ability of the follower engaging yours. On any failure, your follower is taken out of the contest.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Your GM determines any long-term implications for the follower being removed from the contest. Whilst your GM should not end your character’s story without consent, such as via death, they may choose to end the story of a follower in such circumstances, viscerally demonstrating the threat that the PCs face.      </div>

During a scored contest, you can attempt to force a conflict to an early resolution by making a risky gambit. If you win the round, you lodge an additional 1 resolution point against your opponent. However, if you lose the round, your opponent lodges an additional 2 resolution points against you.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>

The total number of resolution points assigned by a round is never less than 0; there is no such thing as a negative resolution point.      </div>

When you wish to join a scored contest in progress, you and your GM should discuss whether you accept the current framing. If so, you can participate.

You may describe an action in a scored contest that is not covered by the ability that you started the contest with. There are two possibilities here: either you are trying to provide color to your actions in the round, without seeking to gain advantage, or you are seeking to gain advantage over your opponent with a novel tactic. In the former case, you can continue to use the ability you started the contest with, as you should not be penalized for wanting to enhance the contest with colorful or entertaining descriptions. In the latter case you should switch abilities, and your GM must decide if the resistance changes because of your new ability. Your GM is encouraged to reward tactics that exploit weaknesses that have been identified in the story so far with a lower resistance. Sometimes your GM may respond with a higher resistance because your tactic looks less likely to succeed due to conditions already established in the story.      </div>

Extended contests 
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
are longer and more dramatic than simple contests. Your GM uses extended contests when the outcome of the struggle is important, to generate suspense for the players, or when they want a back-and-forth struggle. It is something you and your GM should visualize and describe.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
An extended contest consists of one or more rounds, in which you perform actions that are similar to simple contests. However, actions and rounds do not decide the outcome of the whole contest, only who gains or loses advantage points (AP) at that time. You take actions in turn, an exchange, losing and gaining the advantage, until either you or your opponent runs out of advantage points and is defeated.

The size of the bid mirrors how bold and risky your character’s action is. Extreme or aggressive actions mean a high AP bid, and cautious actions require less. If you describe an all-out offensive with your sword cutting vicious arcs, you need to bid a lot of APs; if you say that you are circling your foe cautiously, a low bid is in order. Your GM will look at the level of risk you are taking, and may suggest that you change your bid to better match your actions. If you do not declare a bid before rolling the die, your GM will decide how many points are bid (using 3 as a default), with riskier actions calling for higher AP bids.        </div>

You should agree an additional prize that you desire beyond the stakes agreed at the beginning of the contest. If you succeed in a parting shot you will also gain that prize. Your GM should agree that the additional prize makes sense as an opportunity brought about by your opponent’s defeat.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Your GM should not use a parting shot.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
You once again bid AP and use an appropriate ability against your opponent. Your GM must agree that the size of your AP bid is sufficient to gain the additional prize. The greater the prize the more risk that failure will bring them back into the contest, and so the higher the bid must be. If you succeed, their AP will decrease; their outcome may or may not change, but they cannot finish the round by taking an action against you.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Parting shots 
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
are risky; if you fail, an AP transfer might bring your opponent back into the contest. Your stumble can give them an opening that they can exploit in an effort to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.      </div>

If you are engaged, you may choose to briefly suspend your attempt to best your opponent in an extended contest, in order to do something else. An instance where you are trying to do something else and your opponent is trying to win the contest is called an asymmetrical exchange.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
In an asymmetrical exchange, you do not score APs against your opponent if you win the exchange. Instead, you succeed at whatever else you were doing. You still lose AP if you fail. Often you will be using an ability other than the one you’ve been waging the contest with, one better suited to the task at hand. This becomes additionally dangerous when the score associated with your substitute ability is significantly lower than the one used for the rest of the contest.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
In addition to secondary objectives, as in the above example, you may engage in asymmetrical exchange to grant augments (see §2.5) to yourself or others.      </div>

       <div class="sectiontitle">Switching Abilities</div>

      <div class="sectioncontent">
You can usually switch freely from one ability to another in the middle of an extended contest. It makes sense to do so if you think a different ability will yield an advantage.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Your AP total stays the same when you change your ability, so it makes sense to start the contest with your best ability (appropriate to your goal, of course). If this seems odd, remember that advantage points measure advantage—how well the character is doing in the contest at the current moment. They do not measure proficiency; that is what the target number is for.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
When you switch abilities, your prize does not change, just the means by which you pursue it.      </div>

      <div class="sectioncontent">
To disengage from an extended contest when your opponent is actively trying to keep you in the conflict, use an asymmetrical exchange (see ±5.3.6). You use an ability relevant to your attempt to disengage; the opponent counters with the resistance or, if a PC, an appropriate ability. If the GM attempts to disengage, they use the resistance to do so. These abilities may or may not be those used in the main contest.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
On any victory, you are able to leave the contest.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
If you withdraw from a group extended contest and later decide to rejoin it (or are forced to), you rejoin with the advantage point total you had when you left. If you can show how your leaving and returning substantially changes the situation, the GM may restore some of your AP—for example, if you leave a street fight to get your followers from a nearby tavern. Leaving a contest just to pick up a weapon or catch your breath is an unrelated action, and does not change your advantage points.      </div>

If you are uninvolved in the contest you can also increase a participant’s AP total. First, agree the tactic you are using to help the engaged participant. Second, figure your APs from that ability (see ±5.3.2.1). You bid a number of APs which may not exceed your target number. The resistance is twice the bid.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
On a victory you transfer that number of the participant. On a defeat you transfer that number to the participant’s opponent.      </div>

      <div class="sectioncaption">
       <div class="sectiontitle">Edges and Handicaps</div>
      </div>
      <div class="sectioncontent">
Your GM may want rules to represent opponents who strike rarely but with great effect or who strike often but with little impact per blow. The first quality can be represented with an edge; the second, with a handicap. Edges and handicaps are designated using ^ (^5, for example), handicaps with a minus sign (–^5).
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Edges 
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
and handicaps affect only the advantage points bid in an extended contest. Your edge is added to your AP bid when your opponent must lose or transfer APs. Your handicap is subtracted from your bid when your opponent loses or transfers APs. A contestant’s edge or handicap never affects his AP when he defends, only when he is attacking.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Most GMs find edges and handicaps more trouble than they’re worth, and depict these phenomena with description alone. Earlier books made more extensive use of edges and handicaps to represent the quality of equipment carried by the PCs. For example, your suit for chainmail might be ^4 and your sword ^3. In games where restricted access to equipment is a significant part of the setting and your GM wants to use extended contests it may make sense to use them, otherwise we recommend ignoring them.      </div>

In a group extended contest the side that has the last undefeated contestant gains the prize.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Your GM may decide that you suffer individual consequences or gain individual benefits from the outcome of the contests you pursued, regardless of whether your team won or lost. You might be on the winning team, but lost your individual contest and suffer a penalty to ongoing actions as a result. Alternatively, you might be on the losing team, but win your individual contest and gain a benefit as a result. If you lost, your benefit should not be the prize but instead reflect a side-affect of your individual triumph. Similarly, if your team won, your consequence should not limit the prize which your team one, but should reflect a side-affect of your individual loss.

       <div class="sectiontitle">Second Chance</div>
      </div>
      <div class="sectioncontent">
If your PC falls to 0 or fewer advantage points in a standard extended contest, you are defeated. In a group extended contest, however, you can try a second chance to stay in the contest. A second chance represents the knack to come back when your opponent turns away to gloat or deal with the other player characters. A character may only attempt one second chance in any contest.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
To attempt a second chance, you must be free from attention by the opposition. You must spend a story point. This does not provide a bump up on the roll to come; it is the cost of performing a second chance. You can use a relevant ability in a simple contest against the number of APs your PC is below 0. Even if you succeed, a consequences applies: take a –6 to further actions in this contest.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
If you win the simple contest, you rejoin the contest with a positive AP total. Your new total is a 1/4 of your original AP total at the outset of the contest, round up.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Your GM should not use a second chance for the resistance.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Your GM may decide to impost a consequence on you, even if you are later victorious in a contest, or your team wins the prize, that represents the adversity you suffered that brought you initially to defeat.      </div>

      <div class="sectioncontent">
AP lending 
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
is a common and important option in extended contests. You can transfer some or all of your advantage points to another PC engaged in a group extended contest on your side. With more advantage points, they can stay in the contest for longer, or make larger bids without driving themselves to defeat.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
You cannot lend advantage points to yourself.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
If a follower’s AP are already included in your AP total, the follower cannot lend them to you.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Use an unrelated action and describe what your character is trying to do to improve the position of the target. For example, your PC might throw them a weapon, jeer at an opponent, or simply shout words of encouragement. Then, state the number of AP you are trying to lend. (The GM may suggest a higher or lower bid based on the action you describe.) This determines the resistance you face in a simple contest.

    <div class="sectioncontent">
Chained contests 
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
do not defer consequences to the end of the contest, instead your GM applies the consequences to the loser in the contest immediately following a round. This leads to a grittier feel to the contest, but at the price of a death spiral: once you lose the consequences make it likelier that you will lose again. Chained contests tend to produce the most extreme outcomes, as participants tend to accumulate significant consequences.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
To run an chained contest your GM runs a simple contest as normal, and then applies consequences (see §2.6) with immediate effect.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
You decide if you wish to continue the chained contest, and your GM makes a similar determination for the resistance. Both you and your GM then express your intent. If your or your GM wishes to continue, play out another simple contest. If you, or your GM, wishes to disengage, then on a victory you leave the contest, without inflicting consequences on the opposition. If both you and the GM wish to leave the contest, then you both disengage, and the contest ends. Award experience points if appropriate (see §8.1).
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
You can switch abilities within the contest, provided your GM agrees that the new ability represents a suitable tactic to obtain the prize.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
If the penalties suffered by one contestant reduce their ability below 0, they must concede the contest, If it makes sense, your GM may allow you to continue by switching abilities. The GM may decide that accumulated penalties apply to the new ability used in the contest—this may still force you to concede.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
A chained contest can benefit from using the difference between results as a rank when your GM assesses the benefits and consequence (see §2.7.2).
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Chained contests 
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
are asymmetric, in that they accumulate consequences for the loser, and not benefits for the winner. Your GM may decide to award benefits to a victorious PC after the contest ends (see §2.6).

We recommend that your GM chooses ONE form of long contest only, and stick to it, within a given campaign of QuestWorlds. If in doubt, use a scored contest by default.

This document is comprehensive to allow designers and GMs to choose.

Scored contests 
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
have the advantage of speed and simplicity. Extended contests have the advantage of each exchange allowing both parties to take turns acting, over your GM adjudicating who has the initiative; the bidding system also adds drama. Chained contests offer the benefit of grittier exchanges where the outcomes of each round have impact, as opposed to being <div class="delimited quote-1"><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-left">‘</div><div class="delimitedcontent">cosmetic</div><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-right">’</div></div> until the end of the contest.

There’s no particular time scale associated with contests. But some contests may by their very nature be a drama that can’t be resolved at one point in the narrative. Examples include political campaigns, construction projects, or seductions. These can be resolved by long contests where each round is conducted at an appropriate moment, rather than sequentially. Your GM will need to keep track of the resolution or advantage points and the resistance, though this might change as the context changes (a civil war started by the players could impede their castle-building plans). The challenges of each round will vary, and you may use a different ability or augment in the next exchange.    </div>

    <div class="sectioncontent">
Many relationships connect you to NPCs controlled by the GM.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
When you try to use one of these relationships to solve a problem, your tactic is your relationship ability. You can’t simply go to the supporting character you have a relationship with, stick them with the problem, and expect to see it solved.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
If you succeed, the supporting character helps you solve the problem. If you fail, they don’t. As with any ability, you must still specify how the NPC goes about overcoming the story obstacle. Calls on relationships are almost always simple contests.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
In crucial situations, it may seem dramatically inappropriate for you to solve a problem indirectly, by working through others. Your GM can expose the supporting character to serious risk. If the character dies or otherwise suffers a change of status that renders them useless to you, you permanently lose the relationship ability.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Before putting supporting characters at serious risk, your GM should make sure the players understand the magnitude of the possible consequences.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
When supporting characters undertake significant risk, the supporting character may suffer a consequence of defeat commensurate with the level of the defeat in the contest. Or it may simply be your relationship that is damaged or destroyed.    </div>

Once you have determined the sidekick’s base abilities, they allocate 15 additional points between three of them, spending no more than 10 on any one ability.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
You can improve these abilities through the expenditure of experience points.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
You may use any of your sidekick’s abilities as your own. The sidekick can go off and do things without you.      </div>

As a consequence of defeats in which they participated, sidekicks can be killed or leave your service permanently.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Defeat in physical contests can lead to literal death. Metaphorical deaths from non-violent contests indicate they break up with you. The sidekick may angrily withdraw from your service, but is more likely to sorrowfully retire. You may be able to bring a sidekick back from metaphorical death by overcoming story obstacles.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
If you lose a sidekick, you may create a new one without needing to spend a experience point. You must explain how the new sidekick has come to be your new follower.

A retainer is a more or less anonymous servant or helper. You may specify a single retainer, or, where appropriate to your character concept, an entire staff of them.

Like any other ability, a retainer ability allows you to overcome relevant story obstacles by engaging in a contest. To model the contribution of retainers, when you are acting, you can use them to augment your ability. Your GM can rule that consequences apply to retainers.

Retainers

generally regard you with all the affection and loyalty due to an employer or master. If you treat them more poorly than is expected for their culture, your GM should increase the resistance class of attempts to make use of their talents.

To treat an adversary as an ability, rather than a flaw, describe your emotional response to them. Examples: Hates Leonard Crisp, Fears the Electronaut, Sworn Vengeance Against Heimdall.

Normally, your GM should ensure that defeat takes the story for your PC in an interesting new direction. Unlike some games, where your goal is to win against challenges set by the GM, in a storytelling game your goal is to tell a good story together. Just as in fiction the protagonist can suffer all sorts of reversals, so in a storytelling game, your PC should suffer all sorts of adversities before they triumph (or meet their tragic end). As a result, we recommend against the tendency to <div class="delimited quote-1"><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-left">‘</div><div class="delimitedcontent">buy off defeat</div><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-right">’</div></div> with story points in the middle of the story. Instead, use story points when defeat would damage the conception of the character that you have been building during the story, or lead to an unsatisfactory climax to the story.
   <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Your GM should push the story in an interesting new direction on defeat not send it to a dead end. If there is no interesting branch from defeat they should consider an assured contest instead.
   <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
In other genres, it may feel less appropriate that you can <div class="delimited quote-1"><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-left">‘</div><div class="delimitedcontent">cheat certain death.</div><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-right">’</div> </div>For those genres you can simply drop story points without impacting the game.
   <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
In games with a strong player vs. player element, your GM should dispense with story points as they become disruptive if used against each other. 
   <div class="section level-3" id="story-point-pool">
    <div class="sectioncaption">
     <div class="sectiontitle">Story Point Pool</div>
    </div>
    <div class="sectioncontent">
At the beginning of play, your GM will create a story point pool for your group. The story point pool has one story point per PC. During play you can burn one or more points from this pool, after which it is lost. When you burn story points you can edit the story in your PC or group’s favor. You can either do this to improve your result via a bump (see §7.1) or to introduce a helpful fact into the world via a plot edit (see $7.2).
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
You can decide to spend story points at any time. You do not agreement from the other players to do so.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Your GM may feel that the genre they are playing requires a greater pool of story points as in that genre the heroes never seem to lose. You can create a larger story point pool to reflect this but beware that failure and reversals of fortune for the hero are part of most interesting stories. It can be unwise for the GM to remove all sense of threat from the players by giving them a story point pool from which they can bump any roll, or remove all branches of the story that stem from defeat.

Because you burn a story point to use it, your story point pool may become exhausted. The GM has three choices for refreshing your story point pool:

         <div class="itemcontent">The story point pool refreshes whenever your PCs engage in genre-appropriate downtime. Usually the GM plays this out as a montage, asking your character to describe genre appropriate activities in this time period. For example: in a police procedural series, the PCs might gather at a cop bar to drink and talk about their personal problems; in a series about high-school paranormal investigators they might gather in the school library to chill with their mentor, the librarian, and talk about teenage problems.</div>

is a co-operative game, and you may create details about the setting as the normal part of narration. Your GM should allow this, as long as they do not break credibility. So, you may describe your PC walking over to the pot of soup bubbling on the fire, swiping a drink from the tray the waiter is carrying at the governor’s ball, or taking the monorail to the next city to continue your investigation. Your GM should allow these additions without interruption, providing it does not confer significant advantage to your PC. Mostly this will be using elements that have already been established as part of the setting.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
A plot edit is a more significant moment of good fortune that you wish to narrate, that provides advantage to your PC. You are not just describing something that is plausible in the environment, but something whose existence aids you in overcoming story obstacles or uncovering secrets.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
A plot edit might be thought of as <div class="delimited quote-1"><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-left">‘</div><div class="delimitedcontent">fate</div><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-right">’</div></div> or <div class="delimited quote-1"><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-left">‘</div><div class="delimitedcontent">luck.</div><div class="delimitedsymbol symbol-right">’</div></div>

Burning story points for a plot edit allows you to modify the setting or environment in your PC’s favor. The chance encounter in the street with an NPC, favorable weather, car keys in the sun visor, the forthcoming eclipse, the wind that fills the sails.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Your GM is the arbitrator of whether a plot edit is allowed. It should not suspend the disbelief of the other players in the game or setting or hamper their enjoyment. It should not derail or short-circuit the game’s entertainment. The plot edit should, by contrast, be something that enhances the story for all the players.

  <div class="sectioncontent">
Some series revolve around the relationship between a band of influential figures and the community they protect. In defense of the community, they can bolster, expend, and juggle its various resources.
   <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
These rules allow your GM to track the rise and fall of the fortunes of your community, and your impact on them.
   <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
If your GM intend to play a game centered around a community, you should have a relationship ability to that community.
   <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
It is possible that you have relationships with other communities that are not the focus of play. Treat these relationships as abilities that you can call on, but your GM should not track these communities with these rules. Your GM should pick the level of community that provides the greatest dramatic potential from its competition for resources, friendly or otherwise, with its rivals.
   <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Some campaigns do not center on a community, with the adventurers being footloose wanderers. In that case, even if you have community abilities, your GM will not track any community. Before you decide this though, consider where your PCs might turn for help, succor, or aid. Is there somewhere in the campaign defined as a place of refuge and safety for you. It may well be that there is a community, the bar where other footloose adventurers all meet, who will help each other out in a tight spot for example, that your GM can model.

       <div class="sectiontitle">Defining Resources</div>
      </div>
      <div class="sectioncontent">
Communities have resources that your GM defines. Your PC can try to draw on their community’s resources to use them as bonus. If your community is in difficulty, a strained resource might act as a penalty. Your GM should focus on no more than five or so broadly-labeled resource types, so that the PCs can care about (and have a chance of successfully managing) all of them.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Most communities have variants of the following resources, perhaps with more colorful names: 
       <div class="itemgroup itemize level-1 packed-yes symbol-1">
        <div class="item">
         <div class="itemtag">• </div>

Similar communities in the genre, should have the same set of resources.      </div>

       <div class="sectiontitle">Community Questionnaires</div>
      </div>
      <div class="sectioncontent">
Your GM may create a questionnaire that asks the players to make choices about the priorities of their community. The responses to each question should be multiple-choice. Each choice you make adds points to a score for each resource type. Points are awarded according to what the answer reveals about the community’s relative priorities. An answer may give points to more than one resource.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
You can choose your answers by consensus, majority vote, or take turns.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
When you’re done, rank the resources in the order of the scores. Assign the high ranks to the highest scores and the lowest to the low.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
A questionnaire also introduces your setting in a punchy, interactive format, and tailors the community to the players’ desires, increasing their investment in it.      </div>

    <div class="sectioncaption">
     <div class="sectiontitle">Drawing on Resources</div>
    </div>
    <div class="sectioncontent">
You can use community resources as a bonus to your abilities after convincing the community to let you expend precious assets. This requires a preliminary contest using a social ability, most likely your community relationship. Your GM will use a moderate resistance as the baseline, with higher resistances when your proposals seem selfish or likely to fail, and lower ones when everyone but the dullest dolt would readily see their collective benefits. Your GM may increase resistances if your group draws constantly on community resources without replenishing them.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
The lobbying effort and the actual resource use require framing, a clear description of what you are doing, and other details to bring them to fictional life. You cannot use resource abilities directly, but as an bonus to your own abilities.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Use of community resources should pass the threshold for being memorable and entertaining. Normally there should be a clear benefit to the community, or risk to the community. The PC’s actions should be in support of the community, not themselves. Community involvement becomes part of the story. A certain amount of routine support for your character is assumed; a bonus implies that the community is expending abnormal effort on your behalf, that will cost the community itself. 
     <div class="section subsection level-4" id="resource-depletion">
      <div class="sectioncaption">
       <div class="sectiontitle">Resource Depletion</div>
      </div>
      <div class="sectioncontent">
Unlike character abilities, each use of community resources temporarily depletes it. Regardless of outcome a resource drops a rank when used.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Your GM decides when a resource is restored to its original value. Your GM should decide what the credible interval is for the community to recover from the expenditure of effort. At that point, your GM restores the bonus for the resource.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
You might chose to use a resource when it is already depleted, in which case you use its lower rank. Your GM may use this to represent attrition to your community from a continued struggle. A resource that is depleted enough, may become a penalty.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Threats to community resources act as a spur to PC action. Your GM may rule that the outcome from a contest where you did not use the resource may still deplete the rank of a community resource.      </div>

      <div class="sectioncaption">
       <div class="sectiontitle">Required Resource Use</div>
      </div>
      <div class="sectioncontent">
As part of your GM’s setting design, they may specify that certain actions in a setting always require the use of a community resource. Because the resource use is obligatory, it need not meet the usual criteria for entertainment value.      </div>

     <div class="section subsection level-4" id="resource-as-a-penalty">
      <div class="sectioncaption">
       <div class="sectiontitle">Resource as a Penalty</div>
      </div>
      <div class="sectioncontent">
A resource’s rank may fall below 0. If you require use of a community’s resources (see §9.2.2) your actions will be subject to a penalty equal to the resource rank.      </div>

     <div class="section subsection level-4" id="bolstering-resources">
      <div class="sectioncaption">
       <div class="sectiontitle">Bolstering Resources</div>
      </div>
      <div class="sectioncontent">
Your GM may offer you the opportunity to bolster a community resources ahead of need by seeking out and overcoming relevant story obstacles. If you succeed, the community resource improves a rank. Your GM will set the resistance for the bolster. The community’s higher ranked resources should have higher resistances to bolstering. As a default, use the current rank as the resistance to bolstering.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
For clarity, a resource rated at +M can be bolstered to +M2.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Bolstering 
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
lasts until the resource is used. When your GM depletes a bolstered resource following usage, they remove only the additional rank from bolstering.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
If a resource is already suffering from a penalty, bolstering removes that penalty instead of improving the rank.      </div>

      <div class="sectioncontent">
In the background all sorts of other events periodically alter the community’s prosperity. These include the actions of other community members, who are depleting and bolstering resources all the time, as well as the unexpected intrusion of outside forces.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Your GM may decide that the community’s rank in a resource is temporarily at a higher or lower rank due to these outside events. Your GM decides when the resource returns to normal. For a lower rank, this may require you to overcome a story obstacle.      </div>

     <div class="sectiontitle">Outcomes</div>

    <div class="sectioncontent">
Prior versions of the QuestWorlds rules determined a degree of victory by comparing PC and resistance results. We now recommend just having a victory or defeat an narrating from the individual results as faster and simpler in play. But for those who prefer the older approach, or want to maintain compatibility with it, we present those rules in this appendix.
     <div class="section subsection level-4" id="degree-of-victory-or-defeat">
      <div class="sectioncaption">
       <div class="sectiontitle">Degree of Victory or Defeat</div>
      </div>
      <div class="sectioncontent">
Often all you need to know to interpret the outcome of a resolution is whether you gained victory or suffered a defeat.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Sometimes, you’ll want to know how great a victory you won, or how bad a defeat you endured. This may be important in providing consequences or benefits that drive further story.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
All of the resolution methods have an option to yield the Degree of Victor or Defeat for the PC. The possible Degree of Victory or Defeat, from least to greatest, are: marginal, minor, major, complete. Ties are also possible.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
If you struggle against NPCs or abstract forces, the interpretation of the outcome reveals whether you overcome the story obstacle, and any consequences or benefits; your GM narrates the fate of the NPCs or other forces depending on what makes sense. However, when you and another PC engage in a contest then a victory for one contestant means a corresponding defeat for the loser.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
So whilst in a PC vs. PC duel the PC would only be killed on a complete defeat, an NPC, described as a resistance, might be killed on any victory, depending on how the contest was framed.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Tie
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
: Tie means no outcome. Effort was expended, but the net outcome is that nothing consequential occurs, or else both sides lose or gain equally. If this is confusing, and you are not contending with another PC, your GM can rule that you gain a marginal victory.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Marginal Victory
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
: Yes, but… You get what you want, the prize, but there are complications, the effect is more limited than you desired, or you have to make a hard choice between benefits or accept a loss to get one
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Minor Victory
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
: Yes… You get exactly what they want i.e. whatever was the prize in the contest.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Major &amp; Complete Victory
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
: Yes, and… You get the prize, and something else. You gain something, stealing a possession, gaining a new follower, or become renowned in song. If you want to distinguish a complete the effect is often permanent and no new contests should be framed for this story obstacle.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Marginal Defeat
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
: No, but… You don’t get what you want, you lose the prize, but it’s not a total loss. You are able to salvage something from the defeat, a little more if you sacrifice something other than the prize to your opponent, that the opponent agrees to take instead.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Minor Defeat
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
: No… You don’t get what you want, you lose the prize. Any consequences or complications such as injury or loss of influence are short term and easily shrugged off. Just take the loss and rest up.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Major &amp; Complete Defeat
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
: No and… You don’t get what you want, you lose the prize, and there are long-term consequences. The situation might grow worse or more complicated or you might suffer adverse consequences that will require other conflicts to resolve: an injury that needs a healer, an insult that requires a formal apology, a loss of influence with the community that requires a triumph to win their trust again etc. You might be dead, or as good as. The prize is likely lost to you permanently. Or perhaps you lose something, an item is taken from you, a follower deserts you, your reputation lies in ruins as poets mock your defeat. If you want to distinguish, a complete should be bigger loss than a major, but you can often ignore this distinction.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Your GM will use the degree of success to determine any benefits and consequences, but be sure to describe the success in narrative terms.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
If you are using a stretch, see §2.4.1, then major or complete victories you obtain are instead treated as minor victories.      </div>

In a group simple contest rather than overall victory going to the side with the plurality of victories, each side scores a number of outcome points (OPs) for their side on a victory. The number of RPs is determined by the table below (see §9.2.3.1). After all the exchange have been concluded, your GM uses the the difference in outcome points between the two groups and table §9.2.3.2 to determine the degree of victory or defeat
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Depending on which approach seems to grow from the story, your GM may assign consequences or benefits from group simple contests to the entire group, or to individual members who performed either especially well, or especially poorly. Your GM should default to rewarding or penalizing everyone. Your GM should resort to individualized repercussions or benefits only when a group reward defies dramatic credibility, or when competition within the group is a pivotal dramatic issue.

Because they average together the outcomes of multiple participants, group simple contests tend to flatten outcomes, making victories more likely to be marginal or minor than major or complete.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
To overcome this flattening effect, if the outcome of a group simple contest is a tie or victory, you may spend one or more story points to purchase a boost; a boost assures a clearer victory.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
The cost varies by the number of PCs participating:

You may spend twice as many story points as required to gain a double boost. The points may be spent by any combination of players. They remain spent no matter how the contest resolves. You may continue to spend story points to bump your individual result.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
The boost increases the collective victory level by one step. A double boost increases it by two steps.      </div>

For example, your PC Lieutenant Jackson of the Royal Navy has led a shore-action against a French outpost. Lieutenant Jackson and two other PCs have victory outcomes at the end of the contest, so the Royal Navy wins the day. To determine how well the Royal Navy has done your GM looks at the three victorious outcomes for the Royal Navy, a major victory, a minor victory and a marginal victory. The second best outcome is a minor victory so your GM declares that the Royal Navy have a minor victory and have overrun the French outpost, but gained little else.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Later you lead your men in a spirited defense against a French boarding action of your ship. However, the French win the day, with Lieutenant Jackson and the other PCs suffering defeat outcomes at the end of the contest.

To determine individual consequences or benefits, in rising action, even if you engage multiple opponents in a rising action scored contest, only use the last opponent you engaged to determine your individual outcome. In a climatic contest total the resolution points scored against you by all your opponents.

At the end of the contest the APs of the loser determine the benefits for the winner or consequences for the loser. As with all contests, if the contest involved a resistance, and not another PC, we care about your outcome, win or lose, and the GM should feel free to narrate the outcome for the resistance depending on their interpretation of your outcome, which may not be symmetrical. For example, if the benefit of victory for your PC is pumped the GM should feel free to interpret what this means for the resistance: in a melee they might be dead, in a social contest they might be exiled, or they might surrender in the melee or cede ground in a social contest. Your GM should focus on the prize that was agreed when deciding how to narrate the resolution of the contest.

Prior versions of the QuestWorlds rules used the degree of victory or defeat (see §9.3) to determine consequences. Whilst we now recommend that your GM determines consequences using the scale from their interpretation of the outcome. We find this simpler and faster in play. But for those who prefer the older approach, or want to maintain compatibility with it, we present those rules in this appendix.
     <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
You should note that these rules allow the possibility that a PC will end up dying either literally or figuratively and will be removed from the game without intervention. Under the main rules this to be a player choice in response to an outcome not something that should come randomly from the dice.

When you lose a contest, you may suffer consequences: literal or metaphorical injuries which make it harder for you to use related abilities.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
From the least to the most punishing, the five states of adversity are: hurt, impaired, injured, dying, and dead. The first four are possible consequences of any contest. Dying PCs become dead, unless they receive intervention of some sort.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Although the levels refer to physical states of adversity, the consequences can be emotional, social, spiritual, magical, and so on. 
       <div class="section subsubsection level-5" id="hurt">
        <div class="sectioncaption">
         <div class="sectiontitle">Hurt</div>
        </div>
        <div class="sectioncontent">
If you are hurt, you show signs of adversity and find it harder to succeed at contests related to your defeat. Either your flesh or pride may be bruised. Until you recover, you suffer a –3 penalty to all related abilities.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
You may suffer multiple hurts to the same ability. These are cumulative until recovery occurs.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Unless your GM has a dramatic reason to decide otherwise, your hurts vanish at the end of a session, after one day of rest per accumulated hurt, or when in-game events justify their removal.        </div>

       <div class="section subsubsection level-5" id="impaired">

         <div class="sectiontitle">Impaired</div>

        <div class="sectioncontent">
If you are impaired, you have taken a jarring blow, physically, socially, or emotionally, and you are much likelier to fail when attempting similar actions in the future. You suffer a –6 penalty to all related abilities. Impairments combine with hurts and with other impairments.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
As bad as your condition may be, there’s nothing wrong with you that some prolonged inactivity won’t fix. A single impairment goes away after one week of rest, or when an in-game event (like miraculous or extraordinary treatment) occurs to make their removal seem believable.        </div>

If you are injured, you have suffered a debilitating blow which leaves you reeling. Physically you may have lost the use of a limb or sense, socially you may be shunned, and emotionally you may in shock. Although you should heal with time, you suffer a −9 penalty to all related abilities. Injuries combine with impairments and hurts.

If you are dying you will, without rapid and appropriate intervention, expire. To save you, the other PCs must overcome a story obstacle. Their attempt must be credible, using medicine or magic, as defined by your genre. Your GM should use a very high resistance for this contest, unless the story suggests otherwise. According to the conventions of dramatic storytelling, the character typically has just enough time left for the other characters to make this one attempt.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Successful intervention leaves the PC injured. Depending on the narrative circumstances, a complete victory on the intervention attempt may leave them merely impaired.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
If intervention fails, you will die, but not necessarily immediately. Although irrevocably doomed, your GM may rule that the story suggests that you survive long enough to take one final, heroic, action.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
To even take that final action if the GM offers you the chance, you must succeed at a prior contest of wherewithal to rouse yourself to action. Appropriate abilities for the contest of wherewithal include: 
         <div class="itemgroup itemize level-1 packed-yes symbol-1">
          <div class="item">
           <div class="itemtag">• </div>

           <div class="itemcontent">Social humiliation: Savoir Faire, Unflappable, Stoic Dignity</div>
          </div>
         </div>
A contest of wherewithal faces a moderate resistance. Even if you succeed at the contest of wherewithal, you take an automatic bump down penalty whenever you use any related ability in a contest. (The bump down does not apply to the contest of wherewithal itself.) Where it seems apt, your GM may choose to ignore the bump down if you score a major or complete victory on the contest of wherewithal.)
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Any active hurts or impairments continue to be counted against you as well.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Your final action cannot reverse the outcome of the contest that you lost, it must involve a new story obstacle. Your GM will rule if your action is allowable.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Like other states of adversity, dying may be literal or metaphorical. Your standing in society, business or politics may be on the brink of permanent extinction. You may be facing mental death — a permanent lapse into madness or senility.        </div>

If you die as a consequence of physical injuries, you are gone from the game, period.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Death from a non-physical contest will likely be metaphorical. If you die in an economic, social, spiritual, or artistic contest, you permanently lose abilities.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Even only metaphorically dead, your GM may declare that you have undergone changes so dire as to make your PC unplayable. You may be incurably insane, or be so socially shamed that you retire to a life of obscurity or religious meditation.

Just as when you experience defeat you can suffer ongoing ill effects in addition to the loss of the prize at hand, when you win you can gain benefits from that victory.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
A benefit of victory gives you a bonus on the selected abilities, or in the specified situation, as determined by your victory level.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
A PC may apply bonuses from multiple benefits to a single contest.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
From the least to the most robust the four states of fortune are: fresh, pumped, invigorated, and heroic.

If you are fresh, you are lively and find it easier to succeed at contests related to your victory. You are on a roll and feel confident and able. Until you are defeated, you gain a +3 bonus to all related abilities.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
You may be refreshed multiple times on the same ability. These are cumulative until defeat occurs.
         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Unless your GM has a dramatic reason to decide otherwise, your freshness vanishes at the end of a session, after one day of idleness, or when in-game events justify their removal.        </div>

         <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
As good as your condition may be, an extended period of idleness will cause you to lose your edge. A single pumped goes away after one week of idleness, or when an in-game event (like long drunken party) occurs to make their removal seem believable.        </div>

      <div class="sectioncontent">
You can use community resources as abilities after convincing the community to let you expend precious assets. This requires a preliminary contest using a social ability, most likely your community relationship. Your GM will use a moderate resistance as the baseline, with higher resistances when your proposals seem selfish or likely to fail, and lower ones when everyone but the dullest dolt would readily see their collective benefits. Your GM may increase resistances if your group draws constantly on community resources without replenishing them.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
The lobbying effort and the actual resource use require framing, a clear description of what you are doing, and other details to bring them to fictional life. You can use resource abilities directly, or to augment your own abilities.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Unlike character abilities, each use of community resources temporarily depletes it.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
On a victory, you win the prize specified by contest framing, and a penalty is applied to subsequent uses of the resource.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
On a defeat, you lose the prize and an even more severe penalty is applied to subsequent resource uses. If you fail to secure the prize you were seeking, the depletion penalty is also applied to your social and community abilities when interacting with members of your community. This reflects community displeasure at your fruitless expenditure.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Penalties 
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
from the Resource Depletion Table replace standard penalties for defeat, not add to them.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Like other modifiers to resources, depletion penalties end at the end of the current interval. These include depletion penalties applied to character abilities. However, a depletion penalty left unattended at the end of the interval can result in a permanent drop in the relevant resource.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
If your GM wants resource depletion to lead to longer-lasting social penalties, at the cost of some extra bookkeeping, they can have the characters shed a 3-point penalty at the end of each interval.

Because the resource use is obligatory, it need not meet the usual criteria for entertainment value. Also, when the resource is used as an augment, you can also add a second augment from some other ability, adjudicated according to the standard rules, including entertainment value criteria. (This way, the required resource use doesn’t penalize you by forcing you to augment with a low-rated resource when you could otherwise use a higher-rated ability.)      </div>

When choosing a penalty arising from a player defeat in a simple contest, your GM will use the consequences of defeat table. For a group contest, the penalty corresponds to the second worst state of adversity suffered by a defeated group member.

Your changes to resources take center stage in a series, but in the background all sorts of other events periodically alter the community’s prosperity.

      <div class="sectioncontent">
When resources endure penalties, you conduct a crisis test at the beginning of each game session to see if trouble strikes the community. A high but penalized score can still lead to crisis, because people have adjusted to the equilibrium it offers and feel squeezed when it shifts on them.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
A crisis test is a simple contest (one for each penalized ability) of the resource score against a resistance equal to the average of all resource scores. Like background event checks, these can’t be augmented or bumped up by player action. On any defeat, the community starts to visibly suffer.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Your GM invents the specific reasons for each fluctuation and narrates them to you.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Crisis tests 
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
should spur you to action, challenging you to find ways to bolster the affected resources (see above). When bolstered, the crisis is reversed. If you neglect your duties or fail, the crisis worsens.

Your GM will call for crisis tests only as needed, as a tool to generate story. If your group already has enough story on its hands, your GM will suspend them until you next need a new plot hook.      </div>

from background events are temporary, unless you take steps to cement your benefits. Doing so requires you to overcome a major story obstacle, perhaps taking focus for an evening’s worth of play. If you succeed, the background event bonus may, as per the next section, later solidify into a permanent increase in the resource’s score.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
When you cement a background bonus, your GM changes their notation of that bonus.      </div>

At the end of your GM’s chosen interval, they review the Resource Notation Table.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Any resource with a bonus of 3 or more in its PC column increases by 1 for each 3 points of bonus, for a maximum increase of 3.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Any resource with a penalty in its Total column decreases by 1 for each 3 points of penalty, for a maximum loss of 2.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Any remaining modifiers are now reduced to 0.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
The GM now start a new Resource Notation Table, with resource scores altered to reflect any changes from the above process.
       <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
Having made permanent changes to the community’s resource scores, your GM then restarts the cycle by again testing for a new set of background events.      </div>

Your GM may decide that certain remarkable triumphs or horrifying catastrophes may directly alter a resource score, independent of the resource tracking system given here. The possibility of a dramatic swing in community fortunes should be made clear by your GM during contest framing, so that you know the prize and can pull out all the stops to secure victory or stave off defeat.      </div>
