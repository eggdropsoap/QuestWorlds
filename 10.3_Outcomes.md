## 10.3 Outcomes

Prior versions of the *QuestWorlds* rules determined a **degree of victory** by comparing PC and **resistance** **results**. We now recommend just having a **victory** or **defeat** an narrating from the individual **results** as faster and simpler in play. But for those who prefer the older approach, or want to maintain compatibility with it, we present those rules in this appendix.

### 10.3.1 Degree of Victory or Defeat

Often all you need to know to interpret the **outcome** of a resolution is whether you gained **victory** or suffered a **defeat**.

Sometimes, you’ll want to know how great a **victory** you won, or how bad a **defeat** you endured. This may be important in providing **consequences or benefits** that drive further story.

All of the resolution methods have an option to yield the **Degree of Victor or Defeat** for the PC. The possible **Degree of Victory or Defeat**, from least to greatest, are: **marginal**, **minor**, **major**, **complete**. **Ties** are also possible.

If you struggle against NPCs or abstract forces, the interpretation of the **outcome** reveals whether you overcome the **story obstacle**, and any **consequences or benefits**; your GM narrates the fate of the NPCs or other forces depending on what makes sense. However, when you and another PC engage in a **contest** then a **victory** for one contestant means a corresponding **defeat** for the loser.

So whilst in a PC vs. PC duel the PC would only be killed on a **complete defeat**, an NPC, described as a **resistance**, might be killed on any **victory**, depending on how the **contest** was framed.

**Tie**: Tie means no **outcome**. Effort was expended, but the net **outcome** is that nothing consequential occurs, or else both sides lose or gain equally. If this is confusing, and you are not contending with another PC, your GM can rule that you gain a **marginal victory**.

**Marginal Victory**: Yes, but… You get what you want, the **prize**, but there are complications, the effect is more limited than you desired, or you have to make a hard choice between benefits or accept a loss to get one

**Minor Victory**: Yes... You get exactly what they want i.e. whatever was the **prize** in the **contest**.

**Major & Complete Victory**: Yes, and… You get the **prize**, and something else. You gain something, stealing a possession, gaining a new **follower**, or become renowned in song. If you want to distinguish a **complete** the effect is often permanent and no new **contests** should be framed for this **story obstacle**.

**Marginal Defeat**: No, but… You don't get what you want, you lose the **prize**, but it’s not a total loss. You are able to salvage something from the **defeat**, a little more if you sacrifice something other than the **prize** to your opponent, that the opponent agrees to take instead.

**Minor Defeat**: No… You don't get what you want, you lose the **prize**. Any consequences or complications such as injury or loss of influence are short term and easily shrugged off. Just take the loss and rest up.

**Major & Complete Defeat**: No and… You don’t get what you want,  you lose the **prize**, and there are long-term consequences. The situation might grow worse or more complicated or you might suffer adverse consequences that will require other conflicts to resolve: an injury that needs a healer, an insult that requires a formal apology, a loss of influence with the community that requires a triumph to win their trust again etc. You might be dead, or as good as. The **prize** is likely lost to you permanently. Or perhaps you lose something, an item is taken from you, a **follower** deserts you, your reputation lies in ruins as poets mock your defeat. If you want to distinguish, a **complete** should be bigger loss than a **major**, but you can often ignore this distinction.

Your GM will use the **degree of success** to determine any **benefits and consequences**, but be sure to describe the **success** in narrative terms.

If you are using a **stretch**, see §2.4.1, then **major or complete victories** you obtain are instead treated as **minor victories**.

### 10.3.2 Simple Contest

In a **simple contest**, using the table below (§9.2.1.2) to determine the **degree of victory or defeat** in the **outcome**

#### 10.3.2.1 SIMPLE CONTEST TABLE

|Roll    |Critical      |Success        |Failure        |Fumble         |
|:------:|:------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|Critical|Better roll = Marginal Victory, else tie|Minor Victory|Major Victory|Complete Victory|
|Success |Minor Victory|Better roll = Marginal Victory, else tie|Minor Victory|Major Victory|
|Failure |Major Victory|Minor Victory|Better roll = Marginal Victory, else tie|Minor Victory|
|Fumble  |Complete Victory|Major Victory|Minor Victory|Tie*|

* In a **group simple contest** (see below), your GM may declare that both contestants suffer a ***marginal defeat** to indicate that, although their **results** cancel out with respect to each other, their situation worsens compared to other contestants.

### 10.3.3 Group Simple Contest

In a **group simple contest** rather than overall **victory** going to the side with the plurality of **victories**, each side scores a number of **outcome points** (OPs) for their side on a **victory**. The number of **RPs** is determined by the table below (see §9.2.3.1). After all the exchange have been concluded, your GM uses the the difference in **outcome points** between the two groups and table §9.2.3.2 to determine the **degree of victory or defeat**

Depending on which approach seems to grow from the story, your GM may assign **consequences** or **benefits** from **group simple contests** to the entire group, or to individual members who performed either especially well, or especially poorly. Your GM should default to rewarding or penalizing everyone. Your GM should resort to individualized repercussions or benefits only when a group reward defies dramatic credibility, or when competition within the group is a pivotal dramatic issue.

#### 10.3.3.1 GROUP SIMPLE CONTEST TABLE

|               |Critical       |Success        |Failure        |Fumble         |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|Critical       |1              |2              |3              |5              |
|Success        |2              |1              |2              |3              |
|Failure        |3              |2              |1              |2              |
|Fumble         |5              |3              |2              |0              |


#### 10.3.3.2 DEGREE OF VICTORY TABLE

|Difference Between OPs|Winning Group's Degree of Victory|
|:--------------------:|:-------------------------------:|
|1                     |Marginal                         |
|2                     |Minor                            |
|3--4                   |Major                            |
|5+                    |Complete                         |


### 10.3.3.3 Boosting Outcomes

Because they average together the **outcomes** of multiple participants, **group simple contests** tend to flatten **outcomes**, making **victories** more likely to be **marginal** or **minor** than **major** or **complete**.

To overcome this flattening effect, if the outcome of a **group simple contest** is a **tie** or **victory**, you may spend one or more **story points** to purchase a **boost**; a **boost** assures a clearer victory.

The cost varies by the number of PCs participating:

* 1 **story point** for 1--3 PCs.
* 2 **story points** for 4--6 PCs.
* 3 **story points** for 7--9 PCs.  
* and so on...

You may spend twice as many **story points** as required to gain a **double boost**. The points may be spent by any combination of players. They remain spent no matter how the **contest** resolves. You may continue to spend **story points** to **bump** your individual **result**.

The **boost** increases the collective **victory** level by one step. A **double boost** increases it by two steps.

### 10.3.4 Scored Contest

In a **scored contest** you compare the difference between the winner's **resolution points** and the loser's **resolution points** to determine the **outcome**. You use one of two tables **rising action** (see §9.2.) or **climax** depending on the dramatic arc of your story.

#### 10.3.4.1 Rising Action

**Rising action** refers to all of the many plot events and complications that occur between the beginning and the climax of a story. During this phase of your GM's story, they will use the **rising action** consequence table to assess **outcomes**.

Find the difference between you and your opponent's **resolution point** scores at the **contest**’s conclusion. Your GM then determines your **outcome** by cross-referencing with the following table to find your **benefits** or **consequences**.

Note, you may suffer a **state of adversity**, even if you win the **prize**.

#### 10.3.4.2 RISING ACTION CONTEST TABLE

|Difference Between RPs|Negative Consequences for Loser|Consequences/Benefit for Winner|Victory/Defeat Level|
|:--------------------:|:-----------------------------:|:-----------------------------:|:------------------:|
|1                     |Hurt                           |Hurt                           |Marginal            |
|2                     |Hurt                           |Fresh                          |Marginal            |
|3                     |Impaired                       |Pumped                         |Minor               |
|4                     |Impaired                       |Pumped                         |Minor               |
|5                     |Injured                        |Invigorated                    |Major               |
|6                     |Injured                        |Invigorated                    |Major               |
|7                     |Dying                          |Heroic                         |Complete            |
|8                     |Dead                           |Heroic                         |Complete            |
|9                     |Dead                           |Heroic                         |Complete            |

#### 10.3.4.3 Climax

For the final, climactic confrontation that wraps up your GM's story, you may suffer a **state of adversity**, even if the **outcome** shows that you won the **prize**. This represents that at the **climax** you may triumph, but be laid low by the effort.

First, determine your **outcome** for the **contest** as for rising action, but in addition, if the outcome show that you gained the **prize** your GM now cross-references the **resolution points** scored against you by your opponent on the **climactic state of adversity** table to determine the **state of adversity** you suffered in winning that **victory**. If you lost the **prize** use the **RPs** scored against you to determine your **outcome** as per the **rising action** table above.

#### 10.3.4.4 CLIMACTIC STATE OF ADVERSITY TABLE

|Total Resolution Points Scored Against PC|State of Adversity|
|:---------------------------------------:|:----------------:|
|0                                        |Unharmed          |
|1                                        |Dazed             |
|2                                        |Hurt              |
|3                                        |Hurt              |
|4                                        |Impaired          |
|5                                        |Impaired          |
|6                                        |Injured           |
|7                                        |Injured           |
|8                                        |Dying             |
|9                                        |Dead              |

### 10.3.5 Group Scored Contest Outcomes

In a **group scored contest** the side that has the last undefeated contestant gains the **prize**.

If the PCs won, determine the group's overall **outcome** by using the second-best **outcome** obtained by the PCs, or if there is only one opponent, the **outcome**. If the PCs lost, determine the group's overall **outcome** by using the second-worst outcome obtained by the PCs, or if there is only one PC, the **outcome**.

*For example, your PC Lieutenant Jackson of the Royal Navy has led a shore-action against a French outpost. Lieutenant Jackson and two other PCs have **victory** **outcomes** at the end of the contest, so the Royal Navy wins the day. To determine how well the Royal Navy has done your GM looks at the three **victorious** **outcomes** for the Royal Navy, a **major victory**, a **minor victory** and a **marginal victory**. The second best outcome is a **minor victory** so your GM declares that the Royal Navy have a **minor victory** and have overrun the French outpost, but gained little else.*

*Later you lead your men in a spirited defense against a French boarding action of your ship. However, the French win the day, with Lieutenant Jackson and the other PCs suffering **defeat** **outcomes** at the end of the **contest**. Looking at your PCs **outcomes** there is a **major defeat**, two **minor defeats** and a **marginal defeat**. The French win the day with a **minor defeat** for your Royal Navy crew.*

To determine individual **consequences** or **benefits**, in **rising action**, even if you engage multiple opponents in a **rising action scored contest**, only use the last opponent you engaged to determine your individual **outcome**. In a climatic contest total the **resolution points** scored against you by all your opponents. If you engage more than one opponent, be sure to add the **resolution points** scored against you by all of them. If you lost, add 1 to your total. Your GM cross-references the total against the **climactic state of adversity** table.

### 10.3.6 Extended Contest Outcomes

At the end of the contest the **APs** of the loser determine the **benefits** for the winner or **consequences** for the loser. As with all **contests**, if the contest involved a **resistance**, and not another PC, we care about your **outcome**, win or lose, and the GM should feel free to narrate the **outcome** for the **resistance** depending on their interpretation of your **outcome**, which may not be symmetrical. For example, if the **benefit of victory** for your PC is **pumped** the GM should feel free to interpret what this means for the **resistance**: in a melee they might be dead, in a social contest they might be exiled, or they might surrender in the melee or cede ground in a social contest. Your GM should focus on the **prize** that was agreed when deciding how to narrate the resolution of the contest.

#### 10.3.6.1 EXTENDED CONTEST TABLE

|Final AP Total |Level of Defeat|Consequence for Loser|Benefit for Winner|
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------------:|:----------------:|
|0 to –10 AP    |Marginal       |Hurt                 |Fresh             |
|–11 to –20 AP  |Minor          |Impaired             |Pumped            |
|–21 to –30 AP  |Major          |Injured              |Invigorated       |
|–31 or fewer AP|Complete       |Dying                |Heroic            |

### 10.3.7 Group Extended Contest Outcomes

In a **group extended contest** the side that has the last undefeated contestant gains the **prize**.

If the PCs won, determine the group's overall **outcome** by using the second-best **outcome** obtained by the PCs, or if there is only one opponent, the **outcome**. If the PCs lost, determine the group's overall **outcome** by using the second-worst outcome obtained by the PCs, or if there is only one PC, the **outcome**.

*For example, your PC Lieutenant Jackson of the Royal Navy has led a shore-action against a French outpost. Lieutenant Jackson and two other PCs have **victory** **outcomes** at the end of the contest, so the Royal Navy wins the day. To determine how well the Royal Navy has done your GM looks at the three **victorious** **outcomes** for the Royal Navy, a **major victory**, a **minor victory** and a **marginal victory**. The second best outcome is a **minor victory** so your GM declares that the Royal Navy have a **minor victory** and have overrun the French outpost, but gained little else.*

*Later you lead your men in a spirited defense against a French boarding action of your ship. However, the French win the day, with Lieutenant Jackson and the other PCs suffering **defeat** **outcomes** at the end of the **contest**. Looking at your PCs **outcomes** there is a **major defeat**, two **minor defeats** and a **marginal defeat**. The French win the day with a **minor defeat** for your Royal Navy crew.*

To determine individual **consequences** or **benefits**, use the **AP** of last opponent you engaged to determine your individual **outcome**.

### 10.3.8 Chained Contests

In a **chained contest** determine the **state of adversity** (see §9.4) to the loser of an exchange from the following table (see 9.3.8.1).

#### 10.3.8.1 CHAINED CONTEST TABLE

|Roll           |Critical       |Success        |Failure        |Fumble                       |
|:-------------:|:-----------------------:|:-----------------------:|:-----------------------:|:-----------------------:|
|Critical       |Worse roll is **hurt**. If tied, no effect.|Opponent **hurt**. If already **hurt** in this contest, Injured. If already injured, Dying|Opponent Injured. If already Injured in this contest, Dying|Opponent Dying: player has them at complete mercy. Contest is over.|
|Success        |PC is **hurt**. If already **hurt** in this contest, Injured. If already injured, Dying|Worse roll is **hurt**. If tied, no effect|Opponent **hurt**. If already **hurt** in this contest, Injured. If already injured, Dying|Opponent Injured. If already Injured in this contest, Dying|
|Failure        |PC is Injured. If already Injured in this contest, Dying|PC is **hurt**. If already **hurt** in contest, Injured. If injured, Dying|Worse roll is **hurt**. If tied, no effect|Opponent **hurt**. If already **hurt** in this contest, Injured. If already injured, Dying|
|Fumble         |PC Dying: opponent has them at complete mercy. Contest is over.|PC is Injured. If already Injured in this contest, Dying|PC is **hurt**. If already **hurt** contest, Injured. If already injured, Dying|Both make a mistake. No effect on contest. Side effects at GM's discretion|

### 10.3.9 Group Chained Contest Outcomes

In a **group chained contest** the side that has the last undefeated contestant gains the **prize**.

If the PCs won, determine the group's overall **outcome** by using the second-best **outcome** obtained by the PCs, or if there is only one opponent, the **outcome**. If the PCs lost, determine the group's overall **outcome** by using the second-worst outcome obtained by the PCs, or if there is only one PC, the **outcome**.

*For example, your PC Lieutenant Jackson of the Royal Navy has led a shore-action against a French outpost. Lieutenant Jackson and two other PCs have **victory** **outcomes** at the end of the contest, so the Royal Navy wins the day. To determine how well the Royal Navy has done your GM looks at the three **victorious** **outcomes** for the Royal Navy, a **major victory**, a **minor victory** and a **marginal victory**. The second best outcome is a **minor victory** so your GM declares that the Royal Navy have a **minor victory** and have overrun the French outpost, but gained little else.*

*Later you lead your men in a spirited defense against a French boarding action of your ship. However, the French win the day, with Lieutenant Jackson and the other PCs suffering **defeat** **outcomes** at the end of the **contest**. Looking at your PCs **outcomes** there is a **major defeat**, two **minor defeats** and a **marginal defeat**. The French win the day with a **minor defeat** for your Royal Navy crew.*

Individual **consequences** or **benefits** will have already been determined by the **chained contest** **outcomes** on each **round**.
