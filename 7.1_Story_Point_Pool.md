## 7.1 Story Point Pool

At the beginning of play, your GM will create a **story point pool** for your group. The **story point pool** has one **story point** per PC. During play you can **burn** one or more points from this **pool**, after which it is lost. When you **burn** **story points** you can edit the story in your PC or group's favor. You can either do this to improve your **result** via a **bump** (see ยง7.1) or to introduce a helpful fact into the world via a **plot edit** (see $7.2).

You can decide to spend **story points** at any time. You do not agreement from the other players to do so.

Your GM may feel that the genre they are playing requires a greater pool of **story points** as in that genre the heroes never seem to lose. You can create a larger **story point pool** to reflect this but beware that failure and reversals of fortune for the hero are part of most *interesting* stories. It can be unwise for the GM to remove all sense of threat from the players by giving them a **story point pool** from which they can **bump** any roll, or remove all branches of the story that stem from **defeat**.

### 7.1.1 Refreshing Story Points

Because you burn a **story point** to use it, your **story point pool** may become exhausted. The GM has three choices for **refreshing** your **story point pool:**

* The **story point pool refreshes** at the beginning of every session of play.
* The **story point pool refreshes** whenever your PCs engage in genre-appropriate downtime. Usually the GM plays this out as a montage, asking your character to describe genre appropriate activities in this time period. For example: in a police procedural series, the PCs might gather at a cop bar to drink and talk about their personal problems; in a series about high-school paranormal investigators they might gather in the school library to chill with their mentor, the librarian, and talk about teenage problems.
* The **story point pool refreshes** whenever the GM deems it necessary, based on their desire to allow you to edit the upcoming story.

Ultimately your GM is always the arbiter of  when and how the **story point pool refreshes**. On a refresh your **story points** pool resets to one **story point** per PC.
