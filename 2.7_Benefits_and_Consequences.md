## 2.7 Benefits and Consequences

**Contests**, in addition to deciding whether you overcome a **story obstacle**, carry additional **consequences**. 

Your GM may simply determine these from what makes fictional sense, given the agreed **prize** for the **contest**, as described above. Optionally your GM may impose **consequences** or provide **benefits** if they desire ongoing **penalties** or **bonuses**. Your GM should always respond to the flow of the story---if narrative consequences are enough, they should not reach for additional mechanical **bonuses** or **penalties**. Your GM should use mechanical **bonuses** or **penalties** where it strains credibility that there is no ongoing consequence or benefit from the outcome of the contest.

In a fight, it may strain credibility that a defeat does not leave you impaired for further physical activity. In a display of oratory before the assembled townsfolk, it may strain credibility if they would not later act according to your rousing words. In a romance, it may strain credibility if the wonderful date night does not improve your chances of taking your relationship to the next level.

### 2.7.1 Consequences

After a **contest**, you may suffer **consequences**: literal or metaphorical injuries.

* In a fight or test of physical mettle, you wind up literally wounded.
* In a social contest, you suffer damage to your reputation.
* If commanding a war, you lose battalions, equipment, or territories.
* In an economic struggle, you lose money, other resources, or opportunities.
* In a morale crisis, you may suffer bouts of crippling self-doubt.

The GM is the arbiter of when a **consequence** should be applied.

Your GM may assign a penalty to reflect this **consequence**. Your GM should assign a **penalty** that corresponds to a **rank**: -3, -6, -9, -M, or -M2. The **rank** will depend on how severe they feel the **consequences** are.

If your opponent defeats you, your GM may use the difference between your **result** and the **resistance's** result to determine the **rank**. If your opponent had a **better success** it is one **rank** or -3. If you were one level of result different, such as you **failed** and they **succeeded**, or you **succeeded** and they rolled a **critical**, then it is two **ranks** or -6, and so on, with your rolling a **fumble** and the GM rolling a **critical** the largest **rank** at 4 for a -M penalty.

If you **defeat** your opponent, your GM may still decide that you suffer a **consequence**, representing fatigue, exhaustion, disapproval or other expenditure of resources on earning the **prize**.

* In a fight, you are left bruised and battered.
* In a social contest, you sacrifice the trust of a marginalized group.
* If commanding a war, you must sacrifice some of your forces for victory.
* In an economic struggle, you take significant losses to win market share.
* In a morale crisis, your resolve alienates the cowardly.

On a **better roll** you might suffer a **consequence** of **rank** 2 or -6, and on a better **result** you might suffer a **consequence** of **rank** 1 or -3.

#### 2.7.1.2 Ending a PC's story

Your GM should not impose a narrative **consequence** on your PC that takes them permanently out of the game, such as by death, without discussion. Some games allow characters to be taken out of the story by the result of a dice roll, but QuestWorlds is a co-operative storytelling game where a failed dice roll should not automatically remove a character from play. However, you, or the GM, might feel that your PC's story has come to an end with this failure, and you can consent to that outcome. Usually, your GM should refrain from suggesting this option unless the story itself suggests it.

A story-ending **outcome** may not just be death. It can include anything that takes the PC out of play, such as exile, dismissal from the secret agency, or a broken heart. In some cases the ending to your PC's story could be ambiguous, allowing the PC to return at a future point when the story makes their salvation possible.

Your GM might declare that the stakes of a particular **contest** place a PC at risk of this being a story ending moment, before the dice are rolled. This may be important for credibility in the story that the group is telling. In this case there should be an option for the PC to avoid or back down from a **contest** that has a risk of ending their story.

### 2.7.2 Benefits

Just as you can experience ongoing ill effects from a **contest**, you can gain ongoing benefits from a **contest**.

* In a fight or test of physical mettle, your workout leaves you sharp for the next encounter.
* In a social contest, you gain confidence and admiration from your triumph.
* If commanding a war, you gain strategic advantage over your enemy.
* In an economic struggle, your profits can be re-invested, or you drive competitors into the ground.
* In a morale crisis, you are buoyed up by success, nothing can stop you now.

Remember that the **benefit** does not have to be directly related to the **ability** used. Look to the goal of the **contest**. The abilities or situation should reflect the **story obstacle** that was overcome and the **tactic** used to overcome it.

* In a fight or test of physical mettle, your triumph has everyone rallying to your cause.
* In a social contest, you win powerful **allies** who will strengthen you in your fight against your enemies.
* If commanding a war, you pillage the enemy city and enrich your army.
* In an economic struggle, you gain status as one of the wealthy elite.
* In a morale crisis, your rallied troops strengthen your army.

The GM is the arbiter of when a **benefit** should be applied.

Your GM may assign a **bonus** to reflect this **benefit**. Your GM should assign a **bonus** that corresponds to a **rank**: +3, +6, +9, +M, or +M2. The **rank** will depend on how great they feel the **benefit** is.

If you win the **prize**, your GM may choose to use the difference between your **result** and their result to determine the **rank**. If you had a **better success** than your opponent it is one **rank** or +3. If you were one level of result different, such as you **succeeded** and they **failed**, or you rolled a **critical** and they **succeeded**, then it is two **ranks** or +6, and so on, with your rolling a **critical** and the GM rolling a **fumble** the largest **rank** at 4 for a +M bonus.

If you lost the **prize**, your GM may still decide that you gain a **benefit**, representing learning, gratitude, or resolve developed from losing the **prize**. 

* In a fight or test of physical mettle, you learn your opponent's weaknesses.
* In a social contest, many feel sympathy for you though they cannot support you.
* If commanding a war, you win the trust of your soldiers through shared suffering.
* In an economic struggle, your organization becomes leaner and fitter.
* In a morale crisis, you reflect on your failure and gain new inner strength.

On a **worse roll** you gain a **benefit** of **rank** 2 or +6, and on a worse **result** you might gain a **benefit** of **rank** 1 or +3.

### 2.7.3 Recovery and Healing

**Consequences** lapse on their own with the passage of time. Your GM will determine when the **consequences** have faded, and you should ask about whether they still apply at each new game session. The worse the **penalty**, the longer it may last, though the GM may reduce its **rank** with time, as you recover or heal. However, youâ€™ll often want to remove them ahead of schedule, with the use of **abilities**.

#### 2.7.3.1 Healing Abilities

The **ability** used to bring about recovery from a **consequence** must relate to the type of harm.

You can heal physical injuries with medical or **extraordinary abilities**.

You can remove mental traumas, including those of confidence and morale, with mundane psychology or through **extraordinary abilities**. You might also remove them through a dramatic confrontation between the victim and the source of the psychic injury.

You use social **abilities** to heal social injuries. You probably have to make a public apology of some sort, often including a negotiation with the offended parties and the payment of compensation, either in disposable wealth or something more symbolic.

You can fix damage to items and equipment with some sort of repair **ability**. If you want to fix an extraordinary item, you may require genre-specific expertise: a broken magic ring may require a ritual to reforge.

Your GM should almost always resolve healing attempts as **simple contests**. An exception might be a medical drama, in which surgeries would comprise the suspenseful set-piece sequences of the game, and your GM might choose a **long contest**.

#### 2.7.3.2 Healing Resistances

The **resistance** to remove a states of adversity is the **base resistance** modified by the **rank** of the **consequence**. So if you were suffering from a **rank** 2 consequence, of -6, you modify the **base resistance** by a **rank** 2 modifier of +6.

Your GM can more easily calculate this as the **base resistance** with a **bonus** that is equal to and opposite your **penalty**. So if you have a **penalty** of -3, it is **base resistance** +3; if you have a **penalty** of -6, it is **base resistance** +6 and so on.

When you make a successful healing attempt, you remove the **penalty**.

### 2.7.4 Waning Benefits

Just as you recover from **consequences** with time, or through healing, so **benefits** fade with time.

At the beginning of a session, especially when a significant period of game-world time passes between the conclusion of one session and the beginning of the next, the GM may declare that all **benefits** have expired or waned. A waning benefit may reduce its **rank** with time, as the effect fades. You are no longer charged with the confidence of your recent victory, the fans have forgotten your last concert, or the people of the village have started to think once again about the day-to-day struggle of their lives and not how the stranger helped them. An expired benefit no longer gives you a **bonus**---your past victories no longer bring you solace, your fickle fans have moved on to the latest sensation.

### 2.7.5 Multiple Benefits and Consequences

A PC may apply **bonuses** from multiple **benefits** to a single **contest**, or apply **penalties** from multiple **consequences** to a single **contest**. **Benefits and consequences** may cancel each other out.

Because it is confusing to track both **benefits and consequences** against the same **ability** your GM may simply rule that one cancels the other out. This is particularly true of social **contests** where a moment of shame can erase your previous triumphs, or your confidence eroded by a **failure**. Physical **benefits** may cancel out; flushed with victory you may be able to ignore pain, but it may defy credibility for wounds to be healed by an athletic performance.

Your GM may simply rule that **benefits** and **consequences** cancel out, or they may take the difference between the two **benefits** and create a new one. for example if you have a +6 **bonus** from impressing the crowd with your previous performance in the dance **contest**, but then suffer an injured ankle with a **penalty** of -3, your gm may rule that your twisted ankle cancels out your energy from the last performance, or your gm might rule that your success sees you through the pain, but you are now only +3 to impress the crowd. 

Your GM may prefer to cancel out in **ranks**, so that if you have a rank 4 **benefit** from your popularity with the village following saving their holy idol, giving you a +M **bonus**, but you make a minor social gaff at the mayor's daughter's wedding of **rank** 1, you drop one **rank** to 3, and a +9 bonus, over reducing +M to +17. This keeps the numbers used for **bonuses** and **penalties** consistent, at the cost of having to track or figure out the **rank** of the **bonus**.
