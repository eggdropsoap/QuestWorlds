## 10.4 Benefits and Consequences

Prior versions of the *QuestWorlds* rules used the **degree of victory or defeat** (see §9.3) to determine consequences. Whilst we now recommend that your GM determines consequences using the **scale** from their interpretation of the **outcome**. We find this simpler and faster in play. But for those who prefer the older approach, or want to maintain compatibility with it, we present those rules in this appendix.

You should note that these rules allow the possibility that a PC will end up dying either literally or figuratively and will be removed from the game without intervention. Under the main rules this to be a player choice in response to an **outcome** not something that should come randomly from the dice.

### 10.4.1 The Consequences of Defeat

When you lose a **contest**, you may suffer **consequences**: literal or metaphorical injuries which make it harder for you to use related **abilities**.

From the least to the most punishing, the five **states of adversity** are: **hurt**, **impaired**, **injured**, **dying**, and **dead**. The first four are possible **consequences** of any **contest**. **Dying** PCs become **dead**, unless they receive intervention of some sort.

Although the levels refer to physical **states of adversity**, the consequences can be emotional, social, spiritual, magical, and so on.

#### 10.4.1.2 Hurt

If you are **hurt**, you show signs of adversity and find it harder to succeed at **contests** related to your **defeat**. Either your flesh or pride may be bruised. Until you recover, you suffer a –3 **penalty** to all related **abilities**.

You may suffer multiple **hurts** to the same **ability**. These are cumulative until recovery occurs.

Unless your GM has a dramatic reason to decide otherwise, your **hurts** vanish at the end of a session, after one day of rest per accumulated **hurt**, or when in-game events justify their removal.

#### 10.4.1.3 Impaired

If you are **impaired**, you have taken a jarring blow, physically, socially, or emotionally, and you are much likelier to fail when attempting similar actions in the future. You suffer a –6 **penalty** to all related **abilities**. Impairments combine with **hurts** and with other impairments.

As bad as your condition may be, there’s nothing wrong with you that some prolonged inactivity won’t fix. A single **impairment** goes away after one week of rest, or when an in-game event (like miraculous or extraordinary treatment) occurs to make their removal seem believable.

#### 10.4.1.4 Injured

If you are **injured**, you have suffered a debilitating blow which leaves you reeling. Physically you may have lost the use of a limb or sense, socially you may be shunned, and emotionally you may in shock. Although you should heal with time, you suffer a −9 **penalty** to all related **abilities**. Injuries combine with impairments and **hurts**.

A single **injury** goes away after a month's rest, or by miraculous intervention, as above.

#### 10.4.1.5 Dying

If you are **dying** you will, without rapid and appropriate intervention, expire. To save you, the other PCs must overcome a **story obstacle**. Their attempt must be credible, using medicine or magic, as defined by your genre. Your GM should use a **very high resistance** for this **contest**, unless the story suggests otherwise. According to the conventions of dramatic storytelling, the character typically has just enough time left for the other characters to make this one attempt.

Successful intervention leaves the PC **injured**. Depending on the narrative circumstances, a **complete victory** on the intervention attempt may leave them merely **impaired**.

If intervention fails, you will die, but not necessarily immediately. Although irrevocably doomed, your GM may rule that the story suggests that you survive long enough to take one final, heroic, action.

To even take that **final action** if the GM offers you the chance, you must succeed at a prior **contest of wherewithal** to rouse yourself to action. Appropriate abilities for the **contest of wherewithal** include:

* Physical action: Endurance, High Pain Threshold, Grim Determination, etc.
* Intellectual activity: Concentration, Iron Will, Love of Country (if action to be attempted is patriotic), etc.
* Social humiliation: Savoir Faire, Unflappable, Stoic Dignity

A **contest of wherewithal** faces a **moderate resistance**. Even if you succeed at the **contest of wherewithal**, you take an automatic **bump** down **penalty** whenever you use any related **ability** in a **contest**. (The **bump** down does not apply to the **contest of wherewithal** itself.) Where it seems apt, your GM may choose to ignore the **bump** down if you score a **major or complete victory** on the **contest of wherewithal**.)

Any active **hurts** or **impairments** continue to be counted against you as well.

Your **final action** cannot reverse the **outcome** of the **contest** that you lost, it must involve a new **story obstacle**. Your GM will rule if your action is allowable.

Like other **states of adversity**, **dying** may be literal or metaphorical. Your standing in society, business or politics may be on the brink of permanent extinction. You may be facing mental death — a permanent lapse into madness or senility.

#### 10.4.1.6 Dead

If you die as a consequence of physical injuries, you are gone from the game, period.

Death from a non-physical **contest** will likely be metaphorical. If you die in an economic, social, spiritual, or artistic **contest**, you permanently lose abilities.

Even only metaphorically dead, your GM may declare that you have undergone changes so dire as to make your PC unplayable. You may be incurably insane, or be so socially shamed that you retire to a life of obscurity or religious meditation. You may be shunned by all around you, sent into permanent exile, or sentenced to long-term imprisonment with no hope of escape.

Table: 10.4.1.7 CONSEQUENCES OF DEFEAT TABLE

|Defeat Level|State of Adversity|Penalty                                                                                           |
|:----------:|:----------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------:|
|Marginal    |Hurt              |–3 penalty to appropriate abilities                                                               |
|Minor       |Impaired          |–6 penalty to appropriate abilities                                                               |
|Major       |injured           |–9 penalty to appropriate abilities                                                               |
|Complete    |Dying             | No actions allowed. If 'final action', automatic **bump** down on uses of appropriate **ability**|

### 10.4.2 Benefits of Victory

Just as when you experience **defeat** you can suffer ongoing ill effects in addition to the loss of the **prize** at hand, when you win you can gain benefits from that **victory**.

A **benefit of victory** gives you a bonus on the selected **abilities**, or in the specified situation, as determined by your **victory** level.

A PC may apply **bonuses** from multiple **benefits** to a single **contest**.

From the least to the most robust the four **states of fortune** are: **fresh**, **pumped**, **invigorated**, and **heroic**.

#### 10.4.2.1 Fresh

If you are **fresh**, you are lively and find it easier to succeed at **contests** related to your **victory**. You are on a roll and feel confident and able. Until you are **defeated**, you gain a +3 **bonus** to all related abilities.

You may be refreshed multiple times on the same **ability**. These are cumulative until **defeat** occurs.

Unless your GM has a dramatic reason to decide otherwise, your **freshness** vanishes at the end of a session, after one day of idleness, or when in-game events justify their removal.

#### 10.4.2.2 Pumped

If you are **pumped**, you are energized, physically, socially, or emotionally, and you are much likelier to succeed when attempting similar actions in the future. You gain a +6 **bonus** to all related abilities. **Pumped** combines with **fresh** and **pumped**.

As good as your condition may be, an extended period of idleness will cause you to lose your edge. A single **pumped** goes away after one week of idleness, or when an in-game event (like long drunken party) occurs to make their removal seem believable.

#### 10.4.2.3 Invigorated

If you are **invigorated**, you are pulsing with hormones, mentally focused, or exuding confidence. Physically you can push your body to new personal bests of achievement, socially confidant and exuding charisma, and emotionally you are in touch with your feelings and resonate with those of others. Although this will fade with time, you gain a +9 **bonus** to all related abilities. **Invigorated** combines with **pumped** and **fresh**.

Being **invigorated** goes away after a month's idleness, or an in-game event, as above.

#### 10.4.2.4 Heroic

If you are **heroic**, you have become unstoppable, physically at peak performance, socially, everyone wants to be you or be with you, and emotionally you have gained new insights into yourself and others around you. Although this will fade with time, you gain a **bump** **bonus** to all related abilities. Being **heroic** combines with **invigorated**, **pumped** and **fresh**.

Being **heroic** goes away after a season's idleness, or an in-game event, as above.

Table: 10.4.2.5 BENEFITS OF VICTORY TABLE

|Victory Level  |State of Fortune|Benefit|
|:-------------:|:--------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|Marginal       |Fresh           |+3                                                                        |
|Minor          |Pumped          |+6                                                                        |
|Major          |Invigorated     |+9                                                                        |
|Complete       |Heroic          |You receive an automatic **bump** up on uses of an appropriate **ability**|

#### 10.4.2.6 Clearly Inferior Opponents

Defeating clearly inferior opponents neither teaches you anything nor significantly enhances your reputation; you are ineligible for a **benefit of victory** if the **resistance** you used in the **contest** exceeded the **resistance** by 6 or more. If, in the case of a **long contest**, you or your opponent used multiple **abilities**, compare the best **ability** you used to their worst.

### 10.4.3 Recovery and Healing

Consequences of **injured** or less lapse on their own with the passage of time. However, you’ll often want to remove them ahead of schedule, with the use of **abilities**.

#### 10.4.3.1 Healing Abilities

The **ability** used to bring about recovery from a **state of adversity** must relate to the type of harm.

You can heal physical injuries with medical or extraordinary **abilities**.

You can remove mental traumas, including those of confidence and morale, with mundane psychology or through **extraordinary abilities**. You might also remove them through a dramatic confrontation between the victim and the source of the psychic injury.

You use social abilities to heal social injuries. You probably have to make a public apology of some sort, often including a negotiation with the offended parties and the payment of compensation, either in disposable wealth or something more symbolic.

You can fix damage to items and equipment with some sort of repair **ability**. If you want to fix an extraordinary item, you may require genre-specific expertise: a broken magic ring may require a ritual to reforge.

Your GM should almost always resolve healing attempts as **simple contests**. An exception might be a medical drama, in which surgeries would comprise the suspenseful set-piece sequences of the game, and your GM might chose a **long contest**.

#### 10.4.3.2 Healing Resistances

Default **resistances** to remove states of adversity are as follows:

Table: 10.4.3.3 HEALING RESISTANCES TABLE

|Consequence of Defeat|Difficulty|
|:-------------------:|:--------------:|
|Hurt                 |Moderate        |
|Impaired             |Raised          |
|Injured              |High            |
|Dying                |Very High       |

#### 10.4.3.4 Outcomes of Healing

When you make a successful healing attempt, you remove one level of **adversity** for each level of **victory**. A **major defeat** increases the subject’s **consequences** by 1; a **complete defeat** adds an additional 2 levels to the **state of adversity**.
