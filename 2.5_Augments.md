## 2.5 Augments

You may sometimes face **contests** where more than one **ability** may be applicable to the conflict at hand. In such cases, you may attempt to use one **ability** to give a supporting bonus to the main ability you are using to frame the **contest**. This is called an **augment**. For example, if your character has the **abilities** "The Queen's Intelligencer" and "Master of Disguise," you might use the latter to **augment** the former when infiltrating a rival nation's capital. Similarly, a character with "Knight Errant" and "My Word is my Bond" **abilities** might use one to **augment** the other when in conflict with a **story obstacle** the character has sworn to overcome.

Abilities that represent special items, weapons, armor, or other noteworthy equipment can be a common source of **augments**. However, this grows tired if over-used and you should try and restrict repeated use  of equipment in this way to **contests** where they are particularly interesting or apropos.

**Augments** can also come from other characters' **abilities** if one character uses an **ability** to support another's efforts rather than directly engaging in the **contest**. **Augments** can even come from outside resources like support from a community (see ยง9) or other circumstantial help.

If you have a good idea for an **augment**, propose it to your GM while the **contest** is being framed. When making your proposal, describe how the **augmenting ability** supports the main one in a way that is both *entertaining* and *memorable*. Don't just hunt for mechanical advantage, show your group more about your PC when you **augment**: their attitudes, passions, or lesser known **abilities**. If you are **augmenting** with a **broad ability** like "Fool's Luck," be prepared to describe the unlikely events that tilt the scales in your favor. Your GM will decide whether the **augment** is justified and can refuse boring and uninspired attempts to **augment**, where you are just looking for a bonus to your roll and not adding to the story.

You may only use one of your own **abilities** to **augment** the **ability** you are using in the **contest**, and you may not use an **ability** to **augment** itself. You may not use a **breakout** to augment its parent **keyword** or another **breakout** from the parent **keyword**. However, **augments** from other players supporting you can add together with your own, along with other **modifiers**, including those from **benefits** and from **plot augments**.

If your GM accepts your **augment** proposal, it will be resolved by one of the methods below. The main **contest** then proceeds as normal, with any bonus from the **augment** added onto the **score** of the **ability** chosen when **framing the contest**. The **augment** remains in effect for the duration of the **contest**.

To grant an **augment** to yourself or another PC in an upcoming **contest**, your GM decides how uncertain the benefit of your **ability** is to the contest. In some genres, certain abilities, such as magic in a fantasy setting, may always be uncertain. 

If use of the **ability** to augment seems unlikely to fail, your GM may treat it as an **assured contest**. As with any **assured contest**, the GM might still ask you to roll if there is a risk that the **augment** results in a **penalty** to other **abilities** such as resources or relationships.

If your GM decides it is uncertain whether your **ability** can **augment** this contest, you engage in a **simple contest** against the **base resistance** before the main contest begins to determine whether the **augment** attempt results in an advantage. Frame this **augment contest** with your GM, making it clear how your supporting **ability** will achieve the goal of making your **ability** in the main **contest** more effective. **Augment contests** may not themselves be **augmented**, and if your **augment** attempt ends in **defeat**, you may not make another attempt at an **augment** for the main **contest**.

If you are victorious in the **augment contest**, your GM will award a **bonus** of +3 to the **ability** used in the main **contest**. If your description of how you were using the **augmenting ability** was particularly entertaining, your GM may increase the **bonus** to +6.
