## 2.12 Ganging Up

Sometimes you may outnumber your opponent. As above, if in doubt, the GM should think of the **resistance** that would be dramatically appropriate for a one-on-one confrontation and then adjust it with a **penalty** of −3, −6, or −9 depending on how significantly you outnumber them. As above, note that unless your opponent is extraordinarily large, you cannot confront them physically with more than about six people (include **followers**) or socially with about two people (again include **followers**) or people just get in each other's way.
