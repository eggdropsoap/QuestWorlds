## 2.1 Abilities

Characters in *QuestWorlds* are defined by the **abilities** they use to face the challenges that arise in the course of their story. Rather than having a standard list of attributes, skills, powers, etc. for all characters, anything that you can apply to solve a problem or overcome a **story obstacle** could be one of your **abilities**. While your GM may provide some example **abilities** to choose from that connect your PC to a particular story or game world (whether created by your GM or by the designer of a particular game), you get to make up and describe most or all of your **abilities**.

Some **abilities** might be broad descriptions of your background or expertise, like "Dwarf of the Chalk Hills" or "Private Detective" - implying a variety of related capabilities. Others might represent specific capabilities or assets such as "Lore of the Ancients," "Captain of the Fencing Team," or "The Jade Eye Medallion."

Ultimately, **abilities** are just names for the interesting things your character can do.

### 2.1.1 Flaws

Your character may have one or more **flaws**. A **flaw** is an **ability** that you do not use to accomplish something, but instead the GM uses to hinder you from accomplishing something, or invokes to force you to act a certain way.

**Flaws** maybe psychological weaknesses such as "Alcoholic" or "Heroin Addict," or physical weaknesses such as "One-Eye," "Wheelchair-Bound" or "Asthmatic." A **flaw** might also be a moral philosophy such as "Code Against Killing," "Pacifist," or "Radical Candor" that limits your behavior in some way. A **flaw** also might be a relationship such as a "Frail Aunt," "Single Dad" or "Blackmailed."

Many **flaws** describe attributes that can be viewed positively. By making it a **flaw** and not an **ability** you are inviting your GM to use it to make your life more difficult, not easier. 

You should not use your **flaw** to accomplish something; if you feel that is likely, make it an **ability** and flag to your GM that you want them to draw on it as a **flaw** at appropriate moments. In that case, record both an **ability** and a **flaw** with the same name.

Ultimately, in *QuestWorlds* a **flaw** is simply something that you invite the GM to use to hinder or prevent your character doing something. In return for the GM exercising the **flaw** you gain **experience points** (see §8.1).

### 2.1.2 Scores, Ratings and Masteries

*QuestWorlds* **abilities** are **scored** on a **rating** of 1–20, representing the **target number (TN)** you need to roll or less to succeed on your roll during a **contest** (see §2.3 for more details).

 Once your **ability** passes 20, you would always be able to roll under it on a D20. So to allow abilities to scale over 20 **scores** we use of tiers of capability we refer to as **Mastery**.  To reflect abilities (or **resistance**s) higher than 20, either permanently through character advancement or a temporarily with **modifier** to a contest roll, note a **mastery** for every 20 points in the ability, and treat what remains as the **rating**. So, for an **ability** of 27, we note one **mastery** and a **rating** of seven written as "7M" and we write the **rating** of 21, as 1M.

The "M" after the **rating** signifies **mastery**. The number in front of the M is the **rating**, and represents the new **target number** you seek to roll or less. Whatever your roll, the mastery then **bumps** your **result**. You **bump** a **success** to a **critical**, and **bump** a **failure** to a **success**. If you roll a **critical** you can **bump** down your opponent. When both you and the resistance have **masteries** they cancel each other out.

Having a **mastery** means that you **succeed** most of the time and **critical** more often; you will only **fail** when you roll a **fumble**, and have a higher chance of a **critical** from rolling under the **TN**.

For example, Trevor Okafor is trying to hover a helicopter over a ravine so that Bethany Ng can winch down to a stranded climber in high cross-winds. The GM calls for a roll. Trevor Okafor has 31 in Pilot, written as "11M". Trevor's player rolls against a **TN** of 11. They roll a 17 and fail, but Trevor's **mastery** means the actual **result** is **bumped** up to a **success** on a 17. This beats the GM's **success** on a 13. Later Bethany Ng is trying to stabilize the victim on the route back to hospital. Bethany has 27 in Medic, written as "7M". Bethany's player rolls against a TN of 7. They roll a 4 and succeed, but the **mastery** means that the actual **result** is bumped up to a **critical** on a 4, which beats the GM's **success** on a 14.

Specific *QuestWorlds* games or genre packs may use other symbols relevant to their setting or genre to denote **mastery** instead of M. If so, this should be clearly noted by their designers.

As a **score** climbs, you may even gain multiple **masteries** in it. **Mastery** tiers above one (representing an overall **score** or 41 or more) are marked with a number to the right of the M symbol. Each successive **score** increase over 20 becomes a new **mastery** tier. Thus, if you have 10M2, you have two **masteries** and a **rating** of 10, (representing a total **score** of 50). 10M3 means that you have three **masteries** and a **rating** of 10, and so on. Multiple **masteries** result in multiple **bumps** up, so with two **masteries** a critical **bumps** to a success.

To simplify **bumping**, when both you and the resistance have **masteries** they cancel out.

See §2.3.7 for more details on **bumps**.

#### 2.1.2.1 No Relevant **ability**

You may sometimes be faced with a **story obstacle** for which you have no relevant **ability** whatsoever. In such cases, you may still enter into conflict with the **story obstacle** using a minimum base **target number** of 6 for your **contest** roll. Like **scores**, it may also be subject to **modifiers**.

#### 2.1.2.2 Using Scores As thresholds

*QuestWorlds* treats **scores** as a measure of how effective you are at solving problems with the **ability**, and does not limit what you can do with that **ability**, provided your actions are credible in genre. Where an important part of the genre is that certain uses of the **ability** are only available when you pass a threshold of experience, often through overcoming story obstacles to improve the **ability** in game, you may chose to set threshold for those **abilities**. For example, a magic system might classify certain supernatural effects as Apprentice, Journeyman, or Master level, and require **ratings** of 15, 5M, or 1M2 (respectively) in a relevant **ability** to even attempt them.

Such departures from abstraction should generally only be made where the increased complexity they bring leads to rewarding choices in a key area of interest to the setting or genre at hand. In most cases, you and your GM can simply follow the fiction surrounding your **ability** and its context within the setting for guidance as to what applications of the **ability** are credible.
